"I am writing this review after half month of heavy usage:Pros:1. Slim phone, easy to handle.2. Bagged with lots of helpful features such as :'Clone phone' which allows copying data from old iPhone or Android which I got to know after giving my old phone a factory reset 🙄'Security Manager' which ensures scanning phone for trojans n malicious stuff'App Hide' allows you to hide personal or sensitive apps'File Encryption' allows you to password protect files'Ultra Game Mode' gives you optimized CPU GPU RAMs to provide some space for smooth gaming experience.3. Performance lag isn't there as I can switch between the apps smoothly, thanks to 120 Hz refresh rate display Snapdragon Octa core processor and 6+6 GB of RAM4. Screen can be split to make room for multiple apps on same screen which is impressive.5. 5000 MAH Battery Lasts for a Day long usage no matter if you use or don't use.6. Bluetooth 5.0 helps connecting multiple Bluetooth accessories quickly without manual workout which I liked too.7. Sound is sufficient to be audible at crowded places. Sound output could have been clubbed with primary speaker to give best multimedia experience while playing media or gaming in horizontal.8. 3.5 mm audio jack is just a Life saver when you don't have Bluetooth with you.9. Dual 5G is there but unfortunately I didn't get time to test it yet, but I am using 3G BSNL on this one and to my surprise it's working smoothly than even how Jio 4G used to run on my older phone.Cons:Expecting premium features in this price segment isn't fare but there is always great scope of improvement, here is what I feel,""THE IMEI NUMBER ISN'T BEING ACCEPTED WHEN I TRIED THE EXCHANGE OLD PHONE OPTION"" EVEN IT IS NOT RECOGNISED BY ONLINE IMEI CHECKING SYSTEM, SEEMS SOME KIND OF FRAUD1. Camera sucks while clicking photos even in broad daylight, I really don't know why there are 2 different cams and despite a 50 MP camera, photos are way pathetic as they get distorted and blur upon zooming qnd despite with such poor quality a single image sizes to 3 MB, the AI as displayed in camera option is just a hoax as it does nothing in improving camera quality, zooming feature is next useless feature in row which is just there for mentioning sake and of no use, the front 8 MP camera clicks poor quality images, so if you're a camera freak, blindly go for OnePlus Nord CE 5G, you'll love the cam quality in affordable price segment.2. Battery drains out way faster than the usage as it's 5000 MAH, there isn't any difference than ordinary 3 or 4000 MAH phone, as they too provide a day long usage.3. Display is FHD and not HDR so you can't stream n experience 4k videos which is quite obvious in this price segment.4. This 13k phone if you'll try to exchange immediately after purchase you'll be offered just 5,800/- and that too when phone is without a single scratch on it which is disappointing.5. As expected it is loaded with bloateares which took around 30 minutes to clean up whole and some stubborn ones can't be removed without rooting the phone which adds more mess, never root your Android btw unless it is the only thing left to do.6. Hybrid SIM slot clubbed with memory card slot so expanding storage will cost you sacrificing secondary sim slot.7. No water proof so better keep it safe from rains n water splashes.Overall if you are willing to get phone just for calling n whatsapp n youtube and gaming importantly then this could be good choice, From my past experience Android hardware decays on performance over period of time so you'll have to replace this one with whatever meager exchange price you'll be offered. I am kind of happy with whatever I am getting in this phone as it is sufficient for my daily usage needs, what suits you best is your choice I believe.",Average phone with less than average features,3.0 out of 5 stars

"I recently purchased the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G in Stellar Green color, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The phone came with a travel adapter included in the box, which is a nice bonus. Let me share my experience with this device.Performance:The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G boasts the world's first Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 chipset, and it truly lives up to the hype. The 6GB RAM paired with the powerful processor ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance even with heavy applications and games. I haven't faced any stuttering or slowdowns, and the 5G capability provides super-fast internet connectivity.Display:The 120Hz refresh rate on this phone is a game-changer. Scrolling through apps and websites is incredibly smooth and fluid. The colors are vibrant, and the display quality is top-notch. Whether you're watching videos or playing games, the visual experience is simply outstanding.Storage:With 128GB of internal storage, there's plenty of space for all my apps, photos, and videos. Plus, if you need more storage, you can always expand it using a microSD card, which is a convenient feature.Battery Life:The battery life is impressive as well. Even with heavy usage, the phone manages to last through the day comfortably. The inclusion of a charger in the box is a thoughtful touch, and it supports fast charging, which ensures you can quickly top up your battery when needed.Camera:The camera performance is good for the price range. The 48MP main sensor captures detailed and sharp images, especially in well-lit conditions. The 5MP macro and 2MP depth sensors are decent additions, but they don't deliver exceptional results in challenging lighting situations.Build Quality:The phone feels sturdy and well-built in hand. The Stellar Green color variant looks stunning with its unique gradient design. The device is also relatively lightweight, making it comfortable to carry around.Value for Money:Considering the features and performance, I believe the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G offers incredible value for money. It competes with devices that are priced higher but delivers a comparable experience at a more affordable price point.Overall, I highly recommend the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G to anyone in the market for a powerful and feature-packed smartphone without breaking the bank. It's a well-rounded device that won't disappoint you, especially if you appreciate a smooth display, fast performance, and 5G connectivity.",Impressive Performance and Value for Money,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G has captured my attention with its blend of features, promising a solid performance in the 5G smartphone arena. Here's a comprehensive review of my experience with this device:Pros:Great Performance: The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G delivers on its promise of excellent performance, making multitasking, gaming, and app usage a smooth and seamless experience.Good Battery Life: With respectable battery endurance, the device keeps up with daily demands, ensuring you stay connected and entertained throughout the day.120Hz Display: The inclusion of a 120Hz display adds fluidity to interactions and enhances the visual experience, especially during gaming and scrolling.Reliable Camera Performance: The camera system of the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G proves dependable, capturing moments with clarity and accuracy.Premium Design: The device's design exudes a sense of premium craftsmanship, making it a stylish addition to your tech ensemble.Cons:Missing Charger in the Box: The absence of a charger in the package might be disappointing to users who expect a complete out-of-the-box experience.Minor Lag and Software Experience: While the device's performance is commendable, some users might notice minor lags across the UI, indicating room for software optimization to enhance the overall user experience.Lack of Night Mode in 4GB RAM Variant: Users of the 4GB RAM variant are left without the convenience of a night mode, potentially affecting low-light photography.Limited 5G Bands: The device supports only two 5G bands, which could limit its compatibility and usability in certain regions.Final Thoughts:The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G stands out for its notable strengths in performance, battery life, display quality, camera capabilities, and premium design. However, it's not without its shortcomings. The absence of a charger and the software experience's minor lags might be areas of concern for some users. Additionally, the lack of a night mode in the 4GB RAM variant and the limited 5G band support could impact certain user preferences and usage scenarios.In essence, the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G offers a commendable performance package, but its drawbacks should be considered in the context of your specific needs and priorities.",A Mix of Performance and Misses,4.0 out of 5 stars

"I recently purchased the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G and wanted to share my experience with this smartphone.In terms of specifications and features, this phone offers a lot for its price. The 5G capability is a great addition, providing faster data speeds and a smoother browsing experience. The overall performance is commendable, and it handles most applications and tasks with ease.However, I did encounter a camera issue after some usage. The camera app would show an error and close abruptly, which was frustrating. Initially, the customer service was not as helpful as I expected. They directed me to visit a service center, but unfortunately, these centers are not easily accessible in smaller towns. Fortunately, after a software update, the issue resolved itself, and the camera started functioning normally.Considering the price range, this smartphone competes well in the market. For users who primarily need a phone for calls and using light applications, this brand is worth considering. However, potential buyers should be aware of the possibility of encountering minor software glitches and limited accessibility to service centers in certain areas.In summary, the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G is a feature-rich smartphone with competitive specifications for its price. If you're a moderate user looking for a budget-friendly 5G-enabled phone, this is worth considering.",After sales service is very difficult,4.0 out of 5 stars

"Reviewed in India on 8 November 2023I had high hopes for the ""iQOO Z6 Lite 5G"", but my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare. The display on the phone stopped working just after the Amazon replacement period ended, leaving me in a bind. I had to make multiple trips to the Vivo service center in Jayanagar, a whopping 17.3 km away from my home.The first visit was for a repair attempt, and despite the supposedly competent service center staff, they couldn't fix the issue. This led to a second visit, where I was promised a free replacement. However, I received a different variant altogether—the non-Lite iQOO Z6. It also cost me extra money to get it.This was my first purchase from Vivo, and suffice it to say, it will be my last. The initial buying experience was atrocious, and the fact that I ended up with a different phone just adds insult to injury. The inconvenience of traveling back and forth to the service center, coupled with the unexpected additional cost, has left me thoroughly dissatisfied.On a slightly positive note, the service at the center was decent. However, that small silver lining does little to salvage the overall disappointment and frustration caused by this entire ordeal.

"To all those who are searching for budget 5G phones please skip this phone for your betterment. One of the worst phone I have ever used . The biggest negative in this is it's RAM management. It kills all the background apps while you are working on another app. I faced issue everyday multiple times due to this. Even if you go to message apps for OTP and return to payment app for the payment the payment app will automatically reload from new . The 6GB extended RAM is just a gimmick . Don't fall for these. One of the worst UI I have ever seen. The phone lags multiple times while you use for daily works. And forget about gaming, it will just hang when opening the game like PUBG . Better go for some other options on the market. Even the 5G signal automatically sets to 4G though I'm in 5G network area, Then I have to rest it to 5G again and again multiple times.#Verdict- Don't buy this trash .",Don't Buy,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Writing this review exatly after 9 months of use.Processor:-The main highlights of this phone at the time of launch was snapdragon 4gen1 as it was first in segment,the processor is worst as hellCamera-Worst In segment camera,what can someone do with a camera of 50 mp with a bad aperture and focus.Front camera is the even worse part even Nokia 3310 is better in terms of camera.Display:- What the hell would someone do with a 120 hz display with doesn't responds fluently.Colours are very bad, YouTube videos feel very awfull.UI:- The second best part because funtouch os gives the best battery backup which is the best part of the phone,the 5000 mah battery lasts very long.Note:- Don't buy this phone even if you are drunk, the worst phone on Amazon ,Narzo 50i is even better than this,They wanted to reduce carbon emissions from removing charger ,but they sell it seperately just for money,and the highlight is they giving charger at same price but after 6 months",Worst iqoo mobile,1.0 out of 5 stars
"when I get a call the phone rings like a landline and that screen does not show anything even after pressing all the buttons... Unable to pick up most of the calls.. Missed important calls.It's the slowest phone i ever used, sucks big time with speed. I'm guessing it's some 256 MB antique type of RAM and waste processor.The touch is also not that good. It does not scroll and does not type sometimes.Amazon gives 4 to 5 days to exchange the product, no options to return.I called them and asked if i can return this phone and go for a better model... But they rejected my request, I've lost hope with this iQOO ... They launch stupid phones without proper testing. I used to have 1+5T which was 5 to 6 years old and still worked... I regret to have exchanged it.Though both these phones comes from VIVO i doubt the quality.Don't go for this phone, if you already bought it, you use this to throw as stone to bring down lemons.Battery is not bad. But who the hell wants battery in a phone were you can't pickup calls.",Sucks BIG TIME,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Cons-Gyroscope delay inPUBGCODM and every other game.Even watching 3d movies is a pain in this device.Lots of apps that used to run fine in multiple split screen mode doesn't work on this phone. Chatheafs don't work well except for only messages and WhatsApp and Facebook. You can use any other app with this feature.UI is unrefined and when using discord voice chat the background is visible but the buttons are not visible. Worst investment in terms of a gaming phone.Camera is Ok but only in extremely bright lights. Little dim and you will see grains in your pictures.Not sure about the build quality but seems cheap too. Screen is very bad and delicate and gets easily scratched.Pros areLooks goodBattery life is goodCan run every game without a problem except for Gyroscope delay which is a bummer in FPS games.Overall I'd buy poco over this phone for some extra thousand rupee if you were buying a gaming phone. Or realme 9i.Most codes like*#0*# and other don't work on this phone. Looks like a 2nd hand incomplete UI purchased from a ""chor market.""",Gyroscope delay and UI problems.,1.0 out of 5 stars

"The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G is an acceptably priced budget offering that takes care of key areas comprising a wholesome smartphone experience. It offers good daylight photography, lag-free performance, a fluid display, and long battery life. The only shortcomings arise from a lack of charger inside the box and less than ideal low-light image capturing 1.The phone features a 120Hz IPS LCD panel that measures 6.58 inches diagonally with FHD+ resolution and a waterdrop notch on the top for housing the selfie camera 1. The display is bright, the viewing angles are good, and the sunlight legibility is good as well 2.The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G is currently the only smartphone in India to feature the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 SoC, which is based on a 6nm process 3. iQoo claims that its 5G smartphone can outperform competitor devices 3.In summary, the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G is an impressive budget-friendly phone with a few compromises. It offers good performance, a fluid display, and long battery life but falls short in low-light photography and lacks a charger in the box.

"It's been over 15 days of usage of this phone. Let me summarize the pros and cons of this phone as per my experience:Pros:1. Looks: Stylish and Slim.2. Display: Brilliant quality. Dark mode can create some problem for some apps like Amazon which can be selectively opted  out in display settings.3. Sound: Good quality dual speakers with a slightly lower bass effect but it can be adjusted in settings for earphones.4.Call Quality: Fairly good but not wow5. I have not tested the Camera features but initial impressions seem kind of okay for daylight picsCons:1. Wifi Speed: For some reason the download speed of wifi is low in this phone although the upload speed is good. My wife's IQOO Z5 with the same processor shows a higher wifi speed in test after test.2. This phone has a heating problem probably because of its slim design and glass back. You can mitigate this problem to a great extent by clearing the cache in security app and boosting the ram speed by killing the background tasks every morningThe phone is a mixed bag of features and is suitable for exectutives who can handle it with tact and care. It is certainly not for gaming and rough use. The above pros and cons are my honest observations based on my experience with the phone. There are two things which could have been better the wifi speed quality and network call quality which is just okay okay but not upto the mark.Updated as on 22nd Aug 2022: Most of the problems mentioned above have been rectified after the latest MIUI update 13.0.7.0, hearing problem resolved, black crush problem resolved, battery drain problem resolved. I have no regrets for buying this phone which I felt initially. I am enclosing some photos taken at a village handicrafts exhibition at Hyderabad, with the back camera, you will get some idea of the camera quality.  Satisfied overall.",A Mixed Bag with Classy Looks,5.0 out of 5 stars
"It's the worst mobile I used so far. So buggy that you will hate yourself for choosing this mobile bcoz it looks good and slim. Yes it's still beautiful and slim.1. You will find the Keyboard lagging2. Default Camera takes worst pictures. More saturated if you are taking any flowers it won't even detect Edges properly. We are talking about a mobile above 25,000 rs segment. SERIOUSLY BAD. You will know the truth only when you take pics on this mobile.Attached are two pics taken at same time with default camera(over saturated and no proper edge deduction) and Google camera.3. Power button plus Finger print sensor sometimes does not work and irritates you to core. Bcoz of this I removed the finger print and used only as power on button. Sometimes it gets confused whether it needs to turn on the screen with my finger print or not.4. In WhatsApp when I play audio the Screen will blackout for few seconds while it continues to play audio and then turns on when audio is complete. Even a 12k mobile won't be this buggiestttt.5. When in calls the proximity sensor does not sense ur skin and the screen will still be on.6. To surprise sometimes when the screen is off the background apps automatically comes active and started playing sounds. It happened with my Facebook and also YouTube. (I know it sounds ridiculous) when I saw the first time it happened. I got surprised how it automatically turned on.7. When mobile is in pocket, it turns on sometimes and background apps and phone pad gets opened on its own. Only when you hear the sound you will realise it's turned on.8. Another surprise, when we think we need to exchange this mobile. It does not even appear in Exchange list in Amazon under Xiaomi lost of phones. Not even companies are ready to accept this mobile as exchange. I should assume that this is that bad mobile??9. Sometimes I hear the ringtone and I need to turn on the mobile and I have to go to Notification area to attend my call.10. Battery life is Good for me. I don't play heavy games and I don't use YouTube and Facebook got hours. So it's coming an entire day once changed.Pls decide yourself if you really want this mobile. Even sub 15k segment phone like Poco M3 is far better in my opinion.It's in hands of Xiaomi. Xiaomi can still fix the mobile and make my 25k worth. Of all the issues I mentioned. Many occurred after Updates and I think the Camera is being made useless bcoz of the software. Google camera in this mobile gives better output compared to default camera.",The Most Buggy mobile - Never go a head thinking it looks good,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Here’s my subjective experience of using the Xiaomi Lite 11 NE 5G smartphone –Cons of the phone –No option to disable “Your call is being recorded” voice alert – This is perhaps the most annoying shortcoming of this phone, as per my experience. My REDMI NOTE 7 PRO doesn’t have this glitch. What is the use of recording a telephonic conversation when you alert the person at the other end of the phone that the conversation is being recorded? Can’t believe Xiaomi didn’t even bother to remove this snag.Battery drainage issue - Battery drains faster, especially when you set the refresh rate from 60hz to 90hz. At a standard refresh rate, though the phone’s battery doesn’t seem to drain faster, yet I am not happy with the battery performance of this phone. I am not a gamer and have not played any game since I purchased the phone, still, the battery drains annoyingly faster. The only option you have to at least reduce the speed of battery drainage is to set the phone to BATTERY SAVER mode, but turning on this option will disable the functions of many installed apps. For instance, you will not get automatic notifications from your Gmail app.The screen resolution – Well, it is fine, considering it has a super AMOLED display. However, I felt that it was not as IMMERSIVE as I hoped from the initial impression.CAMERA PERFORMANCE - Mediocre. Trust me, I am not impressed with the picture quality from any mode or angle taken from the phone's camera. But it is not bad either.PROS OF THE PHONE –Best entertainment experience – Watching Netflix and Amazon Prime on this phone was such a visual delight for me. Very impressive and visually striking. Dolby ATMOS feature is something that Netflix strongly recommends for its viewers and I am glad that this phone has it. Since I am a subscriber of the Ultra HD plan of Netflix, I can’t tell in words how happy I feel while binge-watching shows on Netflix, and also on Amazon Prime.SUPER AMOLED visual experience – Though I have said that the display should have been more IMMERSIVE, it doesn’t mean to say that it looks dull. It looks AWESOME!NO LAGS – Powered by 6GB RAM, OCTA-CORE MAX processor, and 128 GB storage capacity, it opens an app in the blink of an eye, gives you buttery-smoothness performance. Forget anything about lag. I played MAD MAX-FURY ROAD 4K on android VLC and really enjoyed the seamless playback performances.FAST CHARGING – This is the second most awesome thing of this phone, after its visual performance. I guess the c-type charger compensates for the battery-drain issue of the phone with its fast charging. In other words, the company wanted to say to us – “So what the battery drains faster? Here’s a charger to fuel it to life.”CONCLUSION –For a non-gamer like me, the phone is GREAT, but it could have been GREATER if it had a powerful battery backup. But I am not complaining because I was already aware of the phone’s battery power specification. 4200mah, according to my experience, is a joke for a phone endowed with so many technical attributes.Even if I am not playing a game on it, but I am sure that if you run any game consuming intensive graphics, the battery of this phone will not stand the pressure and will run dry faster, along with getting heated up due to extensive processing of GPU, RAM, and CPU in the background when you are playing a game. So far I have not experienced heating issues from this phone.Lastly, I wish I had known about the glitch “the call is being recorded”. I am quoting this here just to let you know that if you buy this phone, forget about the privacy of call recording. Alternatively, you can install True Phone from Google Store to rid of this issue, but the point is, was it necessary?","Best for Entertainment purpose, rest features are average.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"11 lite ne 5g is shipped with a different display panel in India (Tianma panel instead of CSOT-tcl panel), Display panel we are offered is suffering severely with a black crush, green tint, pixelation issues with display, which can't be solved with Display replacements either, and it's been a year since users are trying to get xiaomi to acknowledge it/or solution, but no luck with it so far. Developer team refuses to accept it as Software bug, says it's hardware fault, replacing display from service center doesn't help. literally everyone with this device is suffering though this issue on daily basis.What is black crush exactly? -black crush is when black is not showing correctly hence creating a blocky mess as seen in pic.So how does it affect you? -the severity of occurrence is pretty high! which spoils experience of consuming any content on this phone. It's noticeable everywhere, on Always on Display, Charging animation, Notification panel when using AMOLED walls, when consuming Black/Dark content on a phone, it's soo frustrating! you can't consume any darker content (batman like movies) properly on this phone as it spoils the experience of it.Overall this phone is good in every other department but display panel is worse you can see on any phone let alone be fine with spending 27k on phone to face this daily!All Reviewers were handed out sample units which are rocking CSOT tcl panel, which have better PPI , better text sharpness, no black crush issue! Sold in global market only (not India)! Don't listen to them.both panels have different PPI ~267ppi (Tianma - Delta - shipped widely in India) vs 318ppi (Huaxing - Diamond - widely shipped globally except india) for this phone, both use different technology to show pixels as well, one is sharper while the other is not so much! this is SO FRUSTRATING that we customers have been trying since a long time since launching of this phone to get you guys to just acknowledge it but you are not acknowledging it.Xiaomi has used Unethical business tactics! to Cheat with indian consumers! Don't trust my words, search black crush xiaomi on twitter,mi forums, telegram device chat supports! then decide! Don't be blind follower is all I ask! because you are gonna use this phone for year if not more! and living with such issue can be frustrating experience for many of us!",BE AWARE! Black crush is severe issue with this phone with all units sold in India!,3.0 out of 5 stars
"i was confused between Xiaomi 11i & Xiaomi 11 Lite NE 5G, i ordered Xiaomi 11i in the first flipkart sale. As Xiaomi 11i is a good phone in terms of Fresh Boxy Design look with Mediatek Dimensity 920 5G Chipset processor ,Full Hd Amoled Display, 120Hz Refresh rate, Peak Brightness upto 1200Nits, Dual Dolby Speakers, 8 5G Bands & 5160mAh Battery with 67W fast charger within the Box  but it's camera quality is very poor, i don't understand why Xiaomi/Redmi giving useless 2MP Macro Camera in all their phones?? so i cancelled my order from flipkart.Then i got a good deal for Xiaomi 11 Lite NE 5G for 21500/- on Amazon, it's a very beautiful premium looking phone, very light & slim form factor. it comes with SnapDragon 778 chipset processor, Full HD Amoled 10Bit Display with 90Hz Refresh rate, Peak Brightness upto 800 Nits, Dual Dolby Speakers, 13 5G Bands & 4250mAh Battery with 33W fast charger within the Box, this phone doesn't have 3.5mm Audio jack but no need to worry because you will get a Type C audio jack connecter within the box to attach your earphones which is a good thing.. it comes with 64Mp main camera, 8Mp Ultra wide & 5Mp macro camera. Camera setup is good far better then Xiaomi 11i. Snapdragon 778 5G processor is also better then 11i, it scores near about 5lakh in AnTuTu scores, this phone would feel very nice & premium while using. i bought this phone for watching YouTube videos & for Instagram, facebook & other social sites, but what is the main problem in this phone is that it's 10Bit Display which is justified only when you watch HDR content, it will give awesome video clarity & color reproduction but as i knw we hardly watch HDR content in our daily usage, Youtube Instagram videos all are made in 8Bit so this phone will show pale colors even on full HD or 4k settings, you won't feel good while watching youtube or instagram videos, you will see faded or blown out colors on facebook . this phone also have Black crush issues, you will notice while watching  any movie on Netflix or on dark backgrounds. you can see the blue/green tint on the corners of the screen in normal day to day usage. it also have less sharpness if you watch closely, Font will look less sharpen & dull.camera clicks good photos, but on it's display it will show less details but when you will watch those pictures on other device or on laptop or desktop you will see accurate picture with details, so i feel it has some serious issues with it's 10Bit display. it's just a gimmick i guess.otherwise this is a beautiful, light weight phone. if you can deal with these issue go for it in this price range. i mainly watch youtube videos which looks so pale & faded so i have returned this product now i will buy any other phone with good display & color accuracy.",Pls read before buying this phone,3.0 out of 5 stars

"I ordered this device on billion days from Amazon. I'm writing this review after my one day usage.Xiaomi 11 lite ne 5g is must purchase phone for those who have a budget around 25-30K. It comes with Qualcomm snap dragon processor with 64 mp primary sensor,  8 mp ultra wide lense and 5 mp tele macro lense and 4205 mah battery.Camera: I purchased it solely because of it's camera performance and it hasn't disappointed me. For example I've put some photos oI clicked using this device and they turned out to be decent and pretty good. I'm only rating it 4/5 cause it's too natural phptos, other wise macro lense is just awesome and decent.Battery: It has heating problems, but since it comes with  fast charging I haven't yet faced any problem, overall it's pretty nice. And the fast charging has met my expectations. The problem seemed to have ceased after one day usage. Make sure you put your phone to charging after the battery goes down to 20%. I have rated it 4/5 because of it's heating problem.Display: Display is literally 10/10. It comes with a really large display which has my nice impression. Finger print sensor is available too. It has gorilla glass 5 protector in it.Performance: It is really speedy, I've purchased the 8-128 variant. I'll have to rate it 10/10.It has got many features and camera features and it comes with google dialer and google messages , since I'm "" Lite weight device "" Fan. I'm really pleased to have purchased it. Those who have a budget around 25-30K and are in need of good storage and camera, I shall recommend them to give it a go.

"After using one week it came to know that mostly negative reviews are not correct due to little knowledge of camera operating system ,I suggest everyone please watch a lot of utube  videos before giving a negative reviews.First of all its super Macro camera is an amazing performance if you know how to capture a professional picture,night shooting ,day light shooting etc all are wonderful if one knows some technical knowledge.Im fully satisfy with camera quality .I purchased 6 GB with 128 memories capacity in exchange with my old Redmi note 7 pro for ₹10100 and pay nearly ₹ 15000 for this awesome Mobile .My old mobile Redmi note 7 was running nicely but xiomi discountinue futher update that's why I purchased this mobile10bit Amoled display is working well and sound quality is nice too.Performance is good and mobile design is amazing as per expectation. Only one issue battery drain within 24 hours if you use utube and watching picture but a 33 watts fast charger comes with this mobile so you don't worry just one hours it goes 100% full. I'm giving four star because of low battery backup and price .And ofcourse it's very slim and lite , with MIUI 13 latest update 🌹😊👍My policy is to exchange old mobile after every 2/3 years if you want to see your phone run smoothly with new Android version. I advise every mobile holders to buy a mid range mobile and stay it with not more than 2/3 years .",Awesome Mobile a little bit expensive,4.0 out of 5 stars

"So y'all can calculate that from approx 1.5 year I'm using this phone (reviewing from this phone only). That time, my 3 priorities were, 5G phone, Amoled display and Snapdragon, and I got this newly arrived phone with these three features. That time this phone was newly launched and wasn't available in market, so I bought from Amazon, taking a huge risk that whether I'll receive the right/usable phone or not. But bought this after going through a lot of YouTube videos. Working really in good condition till now and camera is very good as many of my friends has claimed this and till now haven't used 5G sim card, good experience was there with BGMI, COD and other arcade games too. With the ambient high temperature, phone also heat up. Speaker sounds are really loud. Charging is really fast, but yeah my charger was getting torn, the white PVC (idk the exact plastic material name) coating of the wire of 'data cable' was tearing up, my brother advised, after charging the phone, detach the charge from the socket instead of keeping it hanged. My brother also had POCO phn, and his charger costing is better than mine, not got tore yet. Listening to music in speaker with loud sound may heat up ur phone a little bit and also while charging in ambient high temperature. Also in summer it takes more time than winter for 100% charging. Most important part is that I haven't updated my phone ig more than 1 time, cuz they are very prudent, they intentionally damage some functions of ur phone in new update so may that u will buy another one, so I haven't updated at all. (There was a loss of finger print function on my uncle's phone after he updated his phone) So I would advise u'll that u may join some Telegram groups where other person has bought this phone and let them update first their phone and according to their review u can update ur phone. And also I exchanged my old phone Moto G5 Plus to buy this phn, and got this at ₹27,499 only (8GB/128GB). """"In India 8GB/256GB isn't available 🥲""""",Bought on 15 oct 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Reviewing my phone after 1 year 7 months of usage/Pro's:1. Very sleek and light design, feels and looks good in one's hand2. Decent Camera: Both front and back cameras are good, with the back one being excellent in clicking pictures unless it's completely dark. One can even shoot amazing quality videos in HD. Moreover, the Camera app comes with a lot of modes as well as a Pro mode.3. Speakers: Despite having dual speakers the audio quality doesn't suffer and is quite loud. It also enhances video/movie-viewing experience.4. Fingerprint and face unlock: The fingerprint sensor nearly does the job and so does the face unlock, although in dimly lit place the face unlock is rendered useless.5. Display: Oh the display, The AMOLED display is really something as using the phone actually gives off a premium feel. Be it a simple Insta reel or an Amazon Video movie, you'll have a great time.6. Battery and charging: My phone lasts almost 1-2 days depending on hard or easy usage respectively. The phone supports fast charging and goes from 0-100 in less than an hour.7. Screen size: For me the screen is just big enough for me to have a good experience watching movies and butCon's1. The latest MIUI updates slow down the phone every once in a while which is otherwise quite smooth. These updates affect the Camera app way more than anything else. If not for these I would have given 5 stars.2. Heating: The phone has a tendency to heat up when playing games for even 15-20 minutes despite the gaming experience being quite smooth.Overall I'm pretty happy with the phone and am quite glad I purchased it.","A beautiful and good mid-range phone, with some flaws",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Before I get to the phone, let me clarify that I'm probably the finickiest person alive when it comes to getting the best value proposition. Believe me, I searched and researched for weeks before zeroing down on this phone.I have to be honest; I was sceptical about shifting from a Samsung phone to one that's lost in the sea of Chinese-branded mobiles. And whether I made the right decision or not is a question that'll find an answer at a later stage.So, what's good about the phone.1. Although it has decent proportions, it is light.2. The 90Hz FHD+ AMOLED screen is good. Those who like to binge-watch stuff on OTT platforms will love it.3. Accompanying the screen are two loud and clear speakers.4. The phone charges real quick. Although my benchmark was an M-series Samsung, you can take a call on that.5. The cameras can produce good clicks, provided you have a steady hand.6. Carrier aggregation, 12 5G bands and three years of OS upgrades + four years of security updates lay a strong foundation.What's not so good:1. The battery. As mentioned above, I've migrated from an M-series Samsung, which had a 6,000mah battery. So, compared to that, the 4,250mah juice pack isn't big enough. Again, though, it'll last for a day easily on regular use.2. I'm still getting used to the MIUI-draped Android. Initial impressions aren't very promising, especially how Xiaomi has ripped off a few cues from iOS. I'm not too fond of that.3. Bloatware. I loathe it. Most of it you can either remove or disable. Best, rob those disabled ones of all the permissions as well. But, there are some which you can't do either. What a shame!4. No headphone jack. So, you'll have to rely on Bluetooth headphones or use a USB-C to 3.5mm converter (supplied with the phone).5. It has a hybrid sim-tray, which can accommodate two nano SIMs or one SIM and a Micro-SD card. This might not be a con for many, but for me, it is.6. The onboard alerts/sounds/ringtones are supremely juvenile. I've had to import some of my own.So, there you have it. The Xiaomi 11 Lite NE 5G. What a name that is! Good luck getting it right in one go! :D",A perfect phone... almost!,4.0 out of 5 stars
"First thing the priceThe price quoted by Amazon is changing day by day. The later price was very low with increased value for exchange and offers seems not fair to those who bought before Oct 10. So very disappointed that have to pay extra 3000 for ordered before Oct 10Phone is overall good but it is not worth the mentioned price of 254991.MIUI 12.5.1  It is worse than previous versions of MIUI in terms of UI customization and user experience. It has good improvements in terms of bug fixes and spam protection but regarding the phone app it is very difficult to change settings and it needs to be improved.2. Data Consumption  As it uses 5G bands data consumption is fast and Almost 90 percent of the apps can't work without data connection. So if you're using operators with 4G+ bands then 2GB data will be consumed within 7 hours of usage.3. Battery life  Battery life is good for first two days but after which drains fast. With data on battery life reduces 75 percent in 8 hours and after which consumption is very slow.4. Heating issue  Phone heating issue happens only when played loud music for more than a hour that too not overheated.5. Camera quality  Camera quality is not as per descriptions. The back camera quality is very good in bright light conditions with good focus upto 5X zoom but in low lighting conditions it is not up to the mark. Night mode is also not good as focus is not good.  Front camera quality is not that of 20 MP but similar to 12MP which is not up to expectation.6. Design  It is light weight but design is not Classy and finish is not that great. The color variant Tuscany coral is completely different from picture. It's not that great.6. Audio and Speakers  If used with headphones audio is good but in terms of speakers it is not as good as other models of Mi / Redmi. When playing loud music phone vibrates as it is very slim you can feel vibrations throughout the back side.7. Display and video  As far display is concerned it is optimised for high resolution so if you're watching pictures with resolution of SD or below, it's not that great. Very disappointed in this.  Overall if the product price is around 16k to 18k, you can buy it otherwise not worth the money for 26K",Good but not excellent. Not worth the money,3.0 out of 5 stars
"Higher than average phone held back by software.Using for past week. Has been mostly smooth sailing. Save for a few judders while scrolling through long lists. 90hz screen shows its presence amply.Side mounted fingerprint sensor is fast though limited by its smaller size. Once in a while more tries are needed for succesful reading of finger print. Using the case improves the accuracy by a bit.Battery has been stellar with ~20% remaining by the end of a normal day with phone calls, messaging, wifi/ data always on and display with 90hz with occasional YouTube viewing.4 Cameras are there... Not used extensively. Not sure I would in the recent or distant future either. Hence can't comment on the performance of the cameras.Size is slightly on the higher size (longer, though width is adequately manageable) with two hands needed for comfortable operation. Reaching the top and bottom with one hand without palm/ finger gymnastics is ruled out.Miui is the deadweight holding this phone back with minor bugs here and there( eg Every restart adds a home screen settings shortcut on the home screen, no way to adjust the grid size in the app drawer etc, unable to swipe to dismiss notifications for music apps long after the app is closed, battery optimisation settings not sticking for some apps and being asked to repeat again after every restart). Annoyances though are minor and not showstopping and can be brushed under the carpet. Bloatware present which has to be uninstalled sometimes using a command line/ special tools.No headphone jack but dongle given to lessen the blow. Sounds ok. Dongle drives high impedance headphones satisfactorily though not to the level a DAC would.Charging speeds are blazing fast though how this will affect battery longevity needs to be seen. An hour or so if charging is enough for (my ) one day use cause.Thin and lightweight splash proof build with upper midrange processor and 3 years guaranteed software update (and 4 years security update) means this phone is sufficiently future proofed. Though again how regular the update promises are kept again remains to be seen.",Value for money phone held back by software,4.0 out of 5 stars

"I am reviewing after more than 1 year of usage.The phone is super slim with very good display and sound effect. I am not a big camera fan and so the camera performance is ok, by my standards. The battery back up is poor given the slim phone which I was aware of at the time of purchase. However the 4100 Mh battery which actually provides less power. It does not last a day even without any gaming activities.However the worst part is the software experience, specially the MIUI. Although the phone has less bloatwares as compared to other REDMI/XIOMI models, yet the experience is terrible. Most irritating aspect is that the call receiving screen does not appear, when you receive a call, resulting in missed calls. The NFC is weak and the phone starts to operate within your call, resulting in undesirable launching of applications. Each software updation sends the phone in a tizzy and takes at leas a week to normalise.",GOOD HARDWARE SPECS BUT TERRIBLE SOFTWARE ISSUES,3.0 out of 5 stars

"I upgraded from a redmi note 7 pro to this phone and have been using this phone for about a month now and here's the difference I feelPerformance:Absolute difference. I can see that I am able to switch between apps in a much more seamless way and no hang or lag in any aspect. Felt a huge jump in it. I'm an average user and not a hard core gamer.Display:Tbh not able to distinguish much except the darkness when it comes to amoled. The 90HZ refresh rate is kinda hard to distinguish from 60. But there's a little differenceSound:Beautiful speakers. Loud enough when I play music or videos without earphones. Love it. However, call audio kinda feels like the same. I cannot boost audio during call like I did in my old phoneCamera:The camera performance is better than my old phone. I can see the significant bump in quality when it comes to taking videos. Stunning stability and amazing video capture modes which are worth the moneyBattery:Not much of an upgrade. Based on my screen time, I would say it's okayish. Not so long lasting. I have to charge twice in three days in normal usage and once a day i use my phone too much.Build quality:The phone is soo light that I was wondering if its actually a phone. I got the white color one and I love the pattern on backside. The metallic finish on the sides provide a premium feel.Overall, worth the money",Lightweight phone that works for it worth,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this mobile mainly bcoz of its slimness and looks.Its been 4+ months and lets discuss the pros and cons .Pros :1. Look and Feel2. Its greatest plus is its slimness which everyone  loves to hold.3. Charging is insanely fast compared to my old mobiles which i had earlier( Poco F1)Cons :1. Camera is a huge let down and it will hang for 2-3 secs if you move the camera slightly when camera is open.2. I am a moderate user using apps like utube, twitter, OTTs ,ms teams, ms office , excel on daily basis. Initially for a period of 2 months all were fine and apps were working as expected. But I started to face slowness in opening these apps from 3rd month onwards.3. My mobile memory will always be less than 50% at any time and still I was facing issue with apps getting started after selecting.4. While watching movie, if we get a call - I could only hear ringtone and not the details of caller. then i need to minimize the video and come back to home screen and open the dialer, then only I can see the caller details. During this whole time you will be hearing the ring tone from the mobile without any issues.5. Fingerprint reader fails sometimes and we need to manually enter the pattern in such cases.I was using Poco F1 for more than 3 years and never ever I faced any such performance issues and now i regret moving to this mobile from Poco.In simple words , Its a mobile from 2015 but wrapped in the body  of a mobile from 2022.Kindly avoid this CRAP.Hope this helps !",Stylish Mobile with a Crappy Configuration,4.0 out of 5 stars

"It's an average phone with good hardware except battery. UI is okay, not comparable to Samsung though. Charging speed is crazy fast, you can go 5-100 in just 40 min. Phone gets warm during charging. But battery discharges as fast as it charges. So don't expect more than a day of moderate use.Camera is okay, again post processing is not comparable to Samsung although camera hardware setup is good.Got upgrade to Android 12 right after starting first time. I think it will get Android 13 as last OS update. After that may be few security updates.Highlight of the phone is how light weight and slim it is. You can't even feel it in pocket!Overall a good buy if you can get it below 20K before exchange. Otherwise, look further. There are ton of phones in 20K range, but none is perfect. This one ticked most of my main requirements compared to OnePlus Nord CE2 Light.",Slim light and great hardware with mediocre battery backup,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Majority of the negative reviews are from the customers who bought their mobile in some festive offer period. I guess we should question the kind of devices being offered on these days.Coming back to my story. I ordered the phone on the very first day of launch from MI website directly. Diamond Dazzle 8+128. I was ditching my one plus 6T which was still working fine except fast draining battery.Pros-Handset is an absolute beauty with chrome sides which gives a premium look-It's slim and weightless as per it's USP, much different than other bulky smart phones-Display is very clear and brighter compared to my last mobiles used, watching HD content over prime video was wonderful experience.-Battery last easily for more than one day for a non gamer, for me on a full charge it runs upto half of the day 2-Super quick charge, some times a 15-20 min charge till i get ready for work will good enough to make it a till evening-camera quality is also quite satisfactory-response is much better after the upgrade of MiUi 13 and Android 12-4g Signal & WiFi reception is fantastic and with good speedCons-In comparison with other mobiles MiUi lacks few important features.-Dark mode needs huge improvement-Selfie camera is not upto the mark-Mobile gets over heated even for video calls-System and pre-installed apps eat up the data, MiUi should allow users to choose pre-installed apps like oxygen.My overall suggestion is to buy the mobile of your are biased for looks, not looking for gaming. It'll satisfy you in day to day functioning","Worth giving a try, it's neither a flagship device nor a entry level device.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Been using this phone since 3 months & I am happy with it. Here is the detailed review:1. Camera: Camera quality is very good in high & low lighting. I have compared it with other new phones & iphone but MI seems to be better. Flash light is not good but the low lighting quality is good. Though it saturates colours in high light but that's good for me.2. Battery: Battery performance is good. I use wifi or mobile data whole day along with bgmi for few hours and it lasts for 20-21 hrs.3. Display: Display is good but the pictures get faded if you are watching videos in low lighting & low brightness. I have tried it with YouTube in low brightness & the videos become faded. Overall the video quality is good.4. Performance: Overall performance is good. It gives good gaming experience and the sound quality is good due to dual speakers.Pros:1. I liked the camera & video quality which is much better than other new phones with some addition features2. Bgmi experience is also good while playing it for 2-3 hours3. Pictures doesn't get saturated when you zoom in4. Battery performance is also good while using wifi or data whole dayCons:1. The call sensitivity is not good. Sometimes the light doesn't goes off when u start talking and it suddenly turns on the speaker2. Video gets faded while watching it in low light3. If u play bgmi or other games more than 3 hours then you will have to charge ur phone twice a day,Light weight with Good camera,4.0 out of 5 stars

"Hey Guys ,This is my 3rd phone in 6 years ,i have constantly changed my phone every 2 years .Will divide this between pros ,medium ,cons.Overall - 4/5Pros1.Light weight ,you won't even feel that it is in your pocket.2. Cameras , picture is coming great like good enough to post in social media without much editing.3. Mi UI 12.5 , For normal users you won't feel much stutter ,they came a long way after the ads debacle.4.33watt Charging - Charges phone within 40-45mins , good enough for me ( i am coming from 18 watt charging).5. Upto 3 years update ,this is more like a flagship level update cycle.6. SD778G is more than enough for casual users , you won't face any lag for next 2 years .Sd778g is par with Sd845/855Medium1. Display - Brightness is not that good in direct sunlight ,indoors is good though. Most likely it depends on unit you get .3.75/52.Battery - Will last for one day ,at the end of day after medium to high usage you will see 10% battery left(6hrs+ SOT).Cons1.Aggressive Nature of Ram management of MiUi ,it's pretty random if apps would be there in the memory or not.To sum it up ,it's jack of all trades but master of none kind of phone .Frankly speaking this is a good buy ,when bought in exchange .I got it for 16k ,which is a steal.My old phone ,got 10k for that ,which i bought it for 8k earlier (2years back) .Buy this phone ,if you are getting a good exchange value .

"I read many comments regarding the heating issue. I also faced the same problem and I got the reason for this. This phone have a feature of RAM extension which uses the swap memory(Which means it uses internal memory as ram if the physical RAM is full) also the speed of internal memory is not equal to physical RAM, so when you use multiple apps, its start using internal memory as a RAM which is not able to handle app switching as physical RAM can do and start struggle, which leads to starting heat. This is my first phone with an inbuilt memory extension feature but I already use this feature in old android by rooting methods when RAM was only 256 or 512 MB.  So don't use the memory extension feature, As per my knowledge, there is no solution even from the software side to resolve it, in today's market companies only make fool us by introducing this type of foolish feature. Just turn off the memory extension feature and if you need more RAM, Go to a higher version, upvote my comment if you read till end and if you find it useful.",Heating issue.............. but have solution,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Battery usage is ok.The biggest problem is with the proxymity sensor it's terrible it won't work at all and with the Google dialer it's even worst experience.During call the phone screen won't turn off and the screen will get automatically switched to different sections.Double tap to wake features won't work half the time and the phone will turn on itself and starts calling emergency number while in pocket.Fingerprint is sidemonted does the job but other brands are giving indisplay fingerprint for half the price range of this mobile.Camera is average not that great. Taking much time to process the image and capturing the image lots of noice present in the picture.Dark mode is the worst of all, you can't see the text for some word on different apps and platform the colour science behind this is too bad. There is no. Different volume control for notification sound it's the same as the ringtone volume which is annoying.The pre-installed Mi apps that can't be deleted or uninstall.Get app which is from Xiaomi itself is so annoying with permission and notifications,The security app will take all the mobile permission with just one push and u can't disable any notification present in it.As this is a slim phone the heat dessipation is bad.The RAM management is not good i see most of the apps restart when I try to access them with in a minute. Out of 6 GB RAM only 1 to 1.3 is available and there is extra 2 GB virtual RAM is definitely ON there is no turn off button or don't know if it's being used or not.Display is good with the side punch hole camera, not that small or not too big.Design is good.Built quality is average all made from plastic, scratches can be easily made if not careful.The camera unit is covered with all plastic material with is 100% scratchable with coins or keys present in the pocket.Front glas is gorilla glass 5 and backe side is frosted but not sure what material is used as i found out online there is no clarity because some one says glass but some one said it's plastic with Frosted design and the scratches will be visible if it gets scratched on it.No headphone jack even though they could have added.",Don't buy you will regret it,2.0 out of 5 stars

"Slim and weightless compared to all phone available. 90hz refresh rate is more than enough for those who are not in to heavy graphics games. And who are all not in games, this is an excellent choice which is a great value for money. One glitch for people who connect their phone to car Audio system for Android Auto or just thru USB, once you connect the phone to USB, the USB CONFIGERATION message would keep on flickering in the phone screen which will not allow to do anything untill you pull the USB off. After lot of googling, the only solution i could find is to use a less costly USB cable which does not supports quick charge. Understood XIAOMI doesn't care to sort this issue even lot of complaints to them. And so, if you are not in to connecting to Android Auto, music thru USB connection, this phone is an excellent choice with a luxurious look.

"All reviews are after 1 month of usage  , I will begin with the cons:-1) Black Crush issue , as you can see in the image I have uploaded. Before purchasing this phone I read in the reviews about this black Crush issue , but I neglected it because I was a fan of Xiaomi Smartphones.2) Battery is Average , not very good not so bad , if you are a gamer , don't go for this phone.3) Camera: I compared the 108 MP of Xiaomi 11i Hypercharge with this Xiaomi 11 Lite NE, no difference, both were same , the issue in this phone is when you hit the corner , where the camera is fixed , the camera vibrates and so does the screen (maybe because the phone is too light), I didn't found it good..Also , the phone lagged for a while when I was clicking pics continuously for 30-40 minutes in sunglight.4)MIUI 13  is not  very smooth I will say , bugs are there..For pros you can see other reviews because I didn't find any extraordinary things that I can share with you...Jitna socha tha utna to nhi mila is phone se , baaki ap logo ki marzi hai🤧Have a Good day :)",Black Crush Issue,4.0 out of 5 stars

"It's a long review but will definitely help you.Cons - I'm using this phone since one month. I'll tell something that not a single YouTuber has ever said. It has a very bad black crash issue. The night scenes in this phone is pathetic to watch. I wanted to return the phone but my mom liked it so I kept it.Battery life is not at all good. This phone is definitely not for gamers. With normal usage only(during office days with WhatsApp and Instagram, internet connection and gps on all day it'll bring your charge from 90 to 25.Camera is also not exceptional. It's good only. You can expect more from a 25k phone. (3.8/5) for the camera.Started hanging a bit(app opening time) after one month of usage only. And with 32% space occupied this is not at all expected. I'm using a 8-128 varient.And just to let you know it has a google dailer. If you'll start recording the other person will immediately know about it.Pros - Stylish, Display is good (apart from black screen you'll enjoy the most) , awesome sound clarity, all sensors are perfectly working, macro camera is LIT (if you know how to click pictures) .  Processor is amazing. Gaming experience will be phenomenal.Note -  This is a very honest and unbiased review. Ive been using Mi phones for 3 years and had an amazing experience (Note 8) and then upgraded to this and I'll say it's a good move but not as expected.Hope this helps you. ☺",Good phone but not worth 26k+,3.0 out of 5 stars
Although the phone is quite good in almost all aspects but MIUI 13 disrupts the user experience and that is unacceptable from a premium mid range phone. Xiaomi should work hard to make the user experience swift and lag free. For a phone powered with Snapdragon 778 Android 12 and MIUI 13 you will always feel that there is some more room to get the best out of it. Otherwise the battery performance is quite impressive keeping in mind that this phone has a capacity of 4250mAh.Display and form factor are 2 major highlights of this phone although I would save my opinion for display since I have not experienced any issues with that as of now but form factor will impress you if you are hunting for a slim and light weight phone. Heat management is something which could have better but I feel that could be because of the it's built which is very slim. Haptics are decent enough if not the best. To conclude I feel that for a phone priced at 27k there are few things which require improvements otherwise this is a good phone. Do note that the box contains a type c dongle to connect with 3.5mm jack since this phone misses out on 3.5mm jack and I would suggest to apply a screen protector as soon as you buy this phone since the factory fitted screen guard will not protect your phone by any means.,MIUI and bugs interupt the user experience,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I generally don't review, but I'm compelled to review about this phone so that I can help other buyers, and this is my honest review and my experience about this trash phone...If you are really looking for good mid range smartphone of 25-27kPlease don't go for this phone, better go for Iqoo Neo 6...my friend buyed Neo 6 at 26k and is much better than my 25k shit.I are very pro redmi user, my last phone was Redmi note 7 pro and I was quite satisfied with that smartphone and I upgraded to this oneDespite having sd 778g, this phone is not very much powerful but good for average use...1.) Camera hangs a lot if you move screen here there,felt so embarassed infront of my friend and family... I got this issue after update to MIUI 13, and camera vibrant every photo you take and looks not very natural, but you can still tolerate that by editing the pics but night camera is horrible 2) charging times also increases after updateIt takes 100+ minutes to charge my smartphone, earlier was good3) battery is not good or big either, it's okay okay type4) most important, black crush issue is still there in night mode, it looks ugly and you can't even screenshot that, it won't capture that, you have to record the video from other smartphone for thatI would say, phone features were looking good and promising, I buyed this after lots of research, and I have always buy a good, value for money smartphoneBut this time, I chokedAt 25k, it might be the best smartphone by feature, but after releasing of Iqoo Neo 6, it's notNo one should go for this phone...I have to tolerate this phone now...Wish MI update and fix this issue",Camera hangs too much after update to MIUI 13,2.0 out of 5 stars

"The phone is extremely thin and light. Even with a cover on it is still lighter than my other phones without cover. The design is great, lovely in hand feeling.The camera is ok. About right for the price. Not the best, not the worst. It's good enough. Would have liked 4k video recording in ultra wide but is not available.Sound is good. Dual speaker. Not as good as my Redmi K20 Pro, that was unbeatable but it's ok.Battery like is fine. If you use at home with WiFi, bluetooth and location disabled and use all the social media apps, YouTube, OTT movies etc then you can expect good screen on time. If you go out and use mobile data, bluetooth, location it will be less as with every phone but you will get a day out of it for sure.One issue I have. The screen is amoled which is a good thing. But there seems to be some issue with the colour temperature. You have to hold it at a certain angle only. If you tilt it, then when viewing a white page, bottom half of screen will be more yellow and warm, top half will be more cooler and blue. I don't get it, maybe it is just my unit. Also when comparing it to screens of other phones I have, it seems to be less sharp, like the text and app icons. Maybe if it is your only phone you won't notice.Overall, it's fine but looking back I should have gone with Samsung M52 (only drawback bad speaker)",Nice phone one issue,3.0 out of 5 stars
"In short, this phone's hardware is absolutely great but this phone's software(to put it politely) is the worst thing known to mankind. Also, the phone's price is only worth, if you bought this using the exchange offer. Otherwise, there are better phones in the 25-30K Market. I got this this for 17.5K, which is a really good deal.The Phone was buttery smooth for about a week or two and then it started throttling and lagging like crazy(After a major MIUI update as well, btw). Phone was barely able to keep any light apps on memory and even the Google keyboard app was killed and I had to restart the phone multiple times to get the keyboard back again. Then there is the MI screen cast app, which requires your location access ALL THE TIME and even enabling it won't help you connect to any screen cast devices. Also, the stock camera app was below par when compared to the photos taken with GCam Mods.Eventually, I lost my patience and flashed a custom ROM. Now the phone is buttery smooth and eveything works flawlessly. Yes, there are lags, even still, but it can be removed by clearing the recent apps in memory, something which we all can do in seconds and something that should've worked in MIUI. Pixel OS is the ROM I'm currently on and it gets updated once every two weeks, SOMETHING WHICH YOU'D NEVER GET IN MIUI. So, DON'T BUY THIS PHONE, IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO FLASH A CUSTOM ROM.","If you are buying this phone, flash a custom ROM",3.0 out of 5 stars
"THE DISPLAY 5/10I have uploaded an image, go into a dark room open this image with low brightness, can you see a black strips like in body of tiger? If you can comment me else its my display issue.Also in low brightness i could see black patches in photos, some times near status bar. I am using amoled for first time and never noticed such things in lcd panels.In brightness its a beautiful display.THE SOFTWARE:bugs after Miui13, On Bluetooth headphones i cannot disconnect Whatsapp call. If i am on a whatsapp call and someone else called you, you won't hear anything from the one you are talking with which is very annoying.There is no pocket mode detection and hence if you enable raise to wake, you phone will start talking to itself when its in you pocket and takes photos too.You will Miss the headphones jack which is absent in this.The battery:Normal usage will last you for a day. No major issue for normal usage. Did not game in it till now.The feel:Its light and you will love it but the device is to wide for one hand use.Call quality is good, speakers sounds are loud.",Its a good device but read this before buying it.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"If you get this device under 20k with exchange offers and bank discount just go for it but keeping in mind that the display has BLACK CRUSH and tint issues, I am not sure if it is a software/hardware issue. This Black crush is visible at low brightness especially other than that display is good enough. (AMOLED displays have such issues to be honest)The haptics on this device is great. Battery backup is excellent keeping in mind that it has small battery compared to that of other devices in this price range. It can easily last for an entire day with max 7hrs of sot (if you do not play games).Many people have issues with MIUI but trust me, MIUI on this device is really really good and also Xiaomi has confirmed 3 yrs of update for this device.Primary sensor is good enough but the ultra wide is not that great. Tele macro sensor is damn good only if you know how to use it properly.Overall great device with BLACK CRUSH issue which can ve solved with updates maybe but till date it has not been solved.And also if you are a custom ROM user, this device already has 2 roms which are almost stable.","Great, superb device but comes with some cons",4.0 out of 5 stars
"This is my 4th day review of this phone. Best feature of this phone is that it is light weight. Camera quality is just ok. You will see saturated colors. I am seeing some lag in the interface while using. I have 8GB variant. Wi-fi turns off itself if you go out of home network and does not automatically turn on for finding network which is frustrating. Youtube videos are not opening and playing on highest quality although i have selected the highest quality settings in youtube. Also after every ad, youtube video quality settings downgrades automatically which is very frustrating. Battery is draining quite fast. On a heavy usage, you can get a battery backup of 8 hours. Another problem is during search of a setting which is not at all efficient. While playing videos on Netflix, you will see distorted captions. You can play HD videos on Netflix and prime. This phone can play 2160 30 fps videos on youtube but lags in playing 2160 60 fps videos. Havent received security updates for january 2022. Still running on November 2021 security update. God knows when they are going to provide latest security update. I havent seen any heating issuea yet.Overall its a decent phone but not worth INR 28k.",Just an OK phone,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Although I've given it three stars overall, and I'm writing this review after four days of using it, and from the same mobile. I will divide the concerns and pros here. I'm starting with:My Concerns1. Selfie camera is the worst: I previously had Oppo F17, which offered an excellent selfie camera. But this one, I cannot even put to describe.2. Battery life isn't too good: Compared to F17, it drains the battery much faster. I'm not a gamer, not an YouTuber still, I see the battery draining pretty quickly.3. The fingerprint touch button is genuinely useless. It would have been better if the fingerprint sensor was on the screen.4. I bought the diamond dazzle, which doesn't dazzle so much. So I probably made a mistake not buying a different color.Things I liked:1. The phone is bigger. Which looks great.2. The main camera is really good. Unlike others, I don't have any concerns about the main 64mp camera. But the zoom option is faulty for the 64mp.3. It's lightweight. I mean very lightweight.4. Sound quality is a bit shrill but good and loud.5. Overall it's a stylish phone.Lastly, I would look for better versions of Oppo next year. So I could exchange this. I'm in love with Oppo and Oppo only, buying Xiaomi wasn't a mistake, but it's an education.",Review After 4 days of Use,3.0 out of 5 stars
What a phone man! Although I agree dual speakers are not that great & also lacs Dolby surround sound but still it's good despite at full volume body vibrates to some extent.  About camera again I agree that it's ultra wide angle 8 MP is not upto the mark in artificial or indoor lighting. Even with selfie 🤳 may be just may be it's lens has less wide angle by default & I wish it would be at center like punch hole as whenever I took selfie my face slightly shift to the right side in the image because the lense is on left otherwise clarity is good.  Now build quality is no less than flagship & processor also feels faster overall but I didn't tried gaming yet.  If it is a mid range smartphone according to Xiaomi then it would be a first with no bugs although bloatware is present with such a smooth UI experience. Battery life is good may be because of that 90hz display in the place of 120hz but when Dolby vision kicks in you will be blown away offcourse with high end  3.5mm wired headphones connected to adapter provided in the box. Also I am facing that text sharpness issue but can be fixed via OTA update.  There is no mention of any type of liquid cooling or dual graphene sheet as it's a lightest phone in the segment so I have a doubt on continuous gaming as the CPU will throttle after more that one hour I guess!  About the pricing so yess build quality wise it feels way more premium than original invoice but still it does not have LPDDR5X ram storage with such a powerful 6nm processor & I wish at least they should provide UFS 3.0 with this 27999/- price tag😒  So with discount it's worth it!👍,Battery life is good despite the numbers although  standby is like 5 star,5.0 out of 5 stars
Was using Vivo y71i (2/16) past 4years & shifted to xiaomi 11 lite NE 5g.Bought this during prime days 8/128 variant just @20k (with bank offers) after overall research . Suddenly shifting to such phone gives a flagship  premium in hand feel. Some pros for considering this phone 1.light weight #158g (I like leight weight phones) 2.10 bit amoled display 3.Good quality dolby stereo speakers 4.Haptic Feedback 5.Overall Good camera setup 64+8+5 +20 front (no useless 2 mp lens) 5mp macrolens clicks good micro pics 6. 778g is really this segment beast 🔥 no heating issues faced. 7. 33W charger which is good for battery charges it in 1hr 10min till full. 8.The camera mode is full of features. Overall a good all rounder phone. Consider it if u get it at best deals. As seeing some -ve reviews I think that they might have got the defective unit. Just go for it !🔥,Got 8/128 at prime sell @20k with bank offers it's worth every penny 🔥,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I am regular user of Xiaomi phone and fan of its quality product , i have used redmi 3S prime for almost 5 and half years and than purchase this one which includes exchange of old phone with good exchange value.Truly slim phone , 12 bands of 5G, excellent display and most light weight phone currently.Very importantly Xiaomi will provide 3 year of Android update and 4 year of security update.Sound quality 5/5Camera 4/5 as taking pictures in day gives good photos but in night the quality is not as good as day.Battery 4/5 , as per my experience i am putting battery to battery saver mode direct after 100% charge and use dark mode , it helps me running battery for a day usage , otherwise I have to charge it twice in a day , i must say that Xiaomi should provide bigger battery as this device offers so many other good features. Charging time around 70 min for 3% to 100%Other than that HDR 10+ , Dolby vision are good function of this phone , which makes this phone a premium one.",It's a good but can be better,4.0 out of 5 stars

"To be honest I was a bit confused during sale time because I was getting this phone in 18k in exchange offer and also k50i in same price 18500 i thought k50i is better because of performance and also latest phone but i choose this one because I already owned iqoo Neo 6 for gaming and performance i just wanted to use a lightweight and slim phone as a personal smartphone...so i goes with this and trust me you won't regret buying this phone because it doesn't have performance issue too 778g processor is more than enough for casual gaming and day to day tasks...i just love this diamond dazzle color also i like jazz blue too and i bought jazz blue for my gf too after 3 days...and this phone looks so premium camera is decent stereo speaker is good not the best but works fine display is amazing not the best like iqoo Neo 6 but still good for multimedia consumption and most thing is battery backup.. you won't believe 4250 mah battery and it's enough for one day 100 to 5 percent superb optimization.....by miui i am not fan of miui but in this phone miui works like smooth butter.....90 hz refresh rate okay if you use 120 hz you can find difference but for normal user it's not big deal.... brightness superbHeavy recommended by me for medium users not for pro gamer  only casual gamer, professional user like office workers it's so handy....Edit:--  After 2weeks....only problem i am facing is its proximity sensor.... sometimes it doesn't work properly.... it works sometime but not for too long....",Must buy,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The build of the phone is really nice , feels good to hold , looks nice.There are many settings which you can find in various videos to stop ads and minor glitches in the UI , camera quality indoors is below average but in good lighting conditions it feels like a totally different phone , the colors come out really well.Battery backup -; Easily lasts a day without any issues on medium to heavy usage even in roaming when it's constantly searching for a new network.Charging-; While 33 watts might seem less but really doesn't take much time by the time you get ready to go out it has enough battery to pull through the day.No network issues and call quality is good.One minor glitch is that sometimes when you are on WiFi and you get a call you can't seem to hear the person on the other side. The moment you turn off wifi you can take calls easily, hope Xiaomi fixes it soon.",Good phone but below average camera,4.0 out of 5 stars

Decent RAM (I feel 6Gb variant is enough for regular day to day use)4. Storage is expandable - I wish dedicated micros sd slot was there5. Very good display and overall look and feel of the phoneCons:1. Battery life may not support a whole day outing if u use the phone often with music and camera2. Use with case. Else it may slip.3. Camera is average. The iphones click better any day so if u have the budget and are camera fan, iPhone or Vivo and Oppo high range phones is better.4. MiUI is not exactly great. I have noticed the phone not doing well when connected with Android auto and many times disconnecting from Android autoOverall a good phone. Buy if u get good discounts and final cost is within 21k.

The phone is really good overall. Below are its Pros and ConsPros-1. Screen quality and sound is pretty good2. Touch is very smooth3. No heating issue4. Camera quality is superb.5. The phone is very light and weight distribution done in the phone is really superb6. The screen gaurd is pre applied when you open the box which is really Good7. The battery life is good but not that great according to me as I am a heavy user. Thanks to the turbo charger provided in box. It charges 60% in 15 min.Cons-1. The software lags even in normal usage. I do lot of app browsing. It lags sometimes.2. RAM management is not at all good. For example if you are using a certain app and suddenly you get a call and while on call you wish to check the app you are using it will again move to its homepage or the app will re-load3. I personally do not find the MI UI userfriendly as was my earlier Honor Phone's UI.,A good buy,4.0 out of 5 stars
"It was a good deal for me as got the phone for 18.5k under exchange offer as I got full value of my previous phone Redmi 6 Pro after using it for 3 years.Pros:1. Color reproduction is good on screen.2. Stereo speakers are good.3. Fingerprint reader is instant.4. Performance is very good for games as well as regular usage.5. Charging speed is very good. Charges from 0 to 100 in 1 hr and the device will last approx 1 day with regular usage.Cons:1. Black crush issue on high contrast images and videos where one can see pixelation in dark areas. Try playing Transient 2 by Dustin Farrell on YouTube for better understanding of this issue. Due to this, in many videos you will feel bad as you will not enjoy HD quality.2. Both back and front camera quality is average. 960fps slow motion feature is useless.3. The interal memory fills automatically each day even after deleting cache.4. The cache cleaner system app is useless as it deletes nothing and the used memory remains same.","Average phone, price should be below 20k",4.0 out of 5 stars

Too light weight.Camera is  good especially at day lighting it clicks like a pro.Front camera could have been better still at the price range but yes it clicks good one.Though the battery is 4250 mah battery it runs good for a day but not with heavy usage.Miui has improved a lot with their updates and bugsDisplay feel and touch is one of the major key in this phones. As smooth as butter.Sometime video clarity gets dim when u share those to other. While if stays clarty in ur phone.If u like a camera and display lover go for it no doubt. Games can be played if u rare lover of it.As shown in review battery is not too bad.U can manage for a day if u are a bit light user.Currently I didn't found any lag issues even if it has its just once on hundred.,Worth the lite!! 4 on 5.,4.0 out of 5 stars
The phone is very good and the form factor is compact and very light. Display with amoled is just amazing and is a treat. Camera is really good for this price point and no compromise on it I'd say and the dynanic range is just osm. The only bummer is battery which lasts little bit lesser than a day(without playing games) which is a lil dissapoint ing. But 33W charging is quite good and takes almost 1hr 15 mins to fully charge which isn't that fast. Sterio speakers are good and the best. I have stopped using my headphones as the speaker is amazing. Has no 3.5mm jack but considering the slimness of the phone it is understandable that it can't be in the design. Not a big deal to me as they give connector inside the box which is surprising and good. Only problem is faced after a week of usage is while watching Netflix rarely there was a slight lag for microseconds which happened to me for like 5 times now. Overall I love the phone. Great package and totally value for money.,Great phone,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I really love the look of this phone, its lighter, slimmer, the sim slot, speaker position, the colous provided, i bought tuscany coral and it really goes soo gopd on meIts been a week time i am using this phone, the main cons i have experienced is it is taking too long to boot the home screen of some apps i.e, amazon, prime, music, ola, microsoft outlook, teams..so far experiencedIt took too long in the sign in process even though there was a good network and it always takes longer time every time the app is started, but other apps works properly like all the mi apps, google apps, uber, whatsapp..For the given processor, RAM, Camera, features, speaker,finger print sensor, battery, and fast charging, it seems about 5 to 6k is additionally charged just for its looks and 5G tag because you will find better phone in 18k range and this 5G support is also not promised as it depends on local operator capabilityOtherwise, i am really liking this phone and hoping to keep it for a longer period☺",Xiaomi11 lite NE 5 G,4.0 out of 5 stars

"Display : Good, but samsung phones have slightly better displays in terms of colors. Display has slight yellow tint. (i only noted this when comparing to my other phone) White is not as white as redmi note 10, despite changing color tone to 'cool' and adjusting other display settings. Colors on Samsung M52 are more vivid, i noted this while watching same 4k video on both phones.Camera : Camera quality of both front and back camera is good. Problem is the red skin tones. Galaxy M52 back camera is better in terms of skin tones and noise level. Macro camera is good but it takes lot of time to focus correctly. Whereas M52 macro camera focuses immidiately.Battery : With my usage (including 2 hours of gaming), battery is lasting 24 hrs, screen set to 90hz.

"I wish I had done more research before shelling out 26k on this phone.The camera is very slow. Takes long to start and even longer to focus and click. Photos are not impressive at all. One would expect better quality with the given specs.Not many people count it as very usefull, but thr phone's torch is pathetic. I often use it when I go for walks at night and sometimes need extra light. This torch is worse than a candle. Doesn't illuminate well. Again, not a big deal for everyone but not something I would expect from a 26k phone.Overall the phone has nothing great. Performance is not smooth. It lags a lot. Is slow in opening apps. (I don't have a lot of apps installed on my phone, nor do I keep it full of media. So there is plenty of space on the phone for it to smoothly function).Overall I'd say that if you are willing to spend 25+k on a phone, do more research and invest in a better brand than this.",Not worth the cost.,2.0 out of 5 stars

The first thing anyone will notice about this phone is how slim and light it is. I was surprised with the network speed I was getting on a 4G VI SIM. It displays VI as 4G+ in Mumbai (pic attached). It has a pretty capable camera setup and good display and sound.ProsLight weight (Good for those who have their phones in their hands most of the time).Good display.Stereo speakers.Good call quality.Good battery life (Got around 5.5-6 hrs screen on time with some juice left)Good camera hardware with some cool software features.Amazing macro camera for its price.Good charging speed for daily use.Software update guarantee by the manufacturer.Free case and screen guard.ConsThe slim shape takes some time to get used to.No earphone jack.CPU is not designed for heavy gaming (It's powerful for moderate gaming and general use).UI doesn't seem to be well optimized (I noticed some apps trying to display in the notch area sometimes and it's not very consistent).Camera software is a maze and can be difficult for a new smartphone user.Does get a little warm on extended use of gaming.I noticed some junk apps and ads but not as much as some other brands.Hybrid SIM/SD card slot.,A good mid-range phone for daily use,5.0 out of 5 stars

"This is my first Mi device and I was worried about too much of bloatwares and pop up ads. But it's more than one month and I am not facing such issues and able to get good smooth experience.Recently got updated Android 12 which is great.Battery life is also decent.Durable too, fell from 3ft to tile and nothing happened. Just using case provided from the box.When using other launchers it's sad that not able to use gesture navigation.Overall I'm very happy about this purchase and only hope that it provides as promised, updates on time.",Good buy,4.0 out of 5 stars
"In 21k, 8+128. Its good. Looks good and lightweight. Camera is good. In low light intenal camera doesn't perform that' much well but we can use google cam in this. Battery, 24 hrs on (normal / low usage) , on heavy use 6-8/9  hrs. Charging 1-100 in 65-67 mins. Performance is good no doubt (snapdragon 778g)............I am editing this review after 5 -6 months of usage.Performance is good but now phone is heating more on using heavy application like bgmi, ect. And that time performange get down and didn't give optimized performence it get's up n down.Battery performance is down after miui14 update, based on Android 13. You have to charge 2 times in a day for above normal usage. Fast charging is good charges phone in 60-70 some time even more based on how much mobile is heated and environment conditions.After miui14 update internal camera night mode much improved.

"1. If you're looking for a slim and lightweight phone this phone is for you.2. Being light and slim comes with a caveat, phone heats in a short span of time hence gaming is a big no on this phone. Good thing is that it doesn't throttle3. Black crush issue is there while using dark mode. Xiaomi needs to fix it via OTA update.4. Software updates is a big plus5. Camera application needs to be optimised since there is lag at times.6. Last but not the least, although this phone boasts a 402 ppi, display doesn't seem that sharp. My old phone Redmi note 8 pro at 395 ppi was significantly sharper than this phone. Display was crisp. The display here is not bad I would say, but it is not upto the mark.","Good phone, not very excellent",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I was really excited to buy this phone,  because it's lightweight..  I'm changine phone after almost 6 years..  My last mobile was Samsung Galaxy On NXT..  Now you'll know,  how much gap I'm jumping from. I exchanged my old mobile and used card offers ans got this phone for 16K( 8+128) variant only because that is the only option available when i was buying it..1. Display (9.5/10) -  120Hz feels like buttery smooth and if u turn on MEMC and AI HDR enhancement in settings while watching videos, you'll get a fantastic media experience. The quality of the Amoled pannel is fantastic. It has widevine L1 support and Dolby Vision suoport. HDR 10+ support. It has everything at this budget.2. Build (9/10) -  Getting a glass build phone,  that too weighing 156g I still wonder how Xiaomi made this.  The in hand feel is excellent.  Best ever I've used.  Diamond Dazzle variant feels new and fresh design3.Battery Life (7/10) -  Getting a less weight phone,  surely battery life is going to suck when compared with its competitors.  But 4000mah is ok for me..  In medium usage, at the end of the day I'm getting 10 to 15% left. 4.Camera (6/10) -  Camera performs excellent in outdoor conditions..  But if you are in low light area the primary sensor also sucks..  But for this price range it is really preforming better than its competitors..  Selfie cam is not good (as usual in MI) Only MI phone,  where Selfie cake performed like a beast is MiA3 (don't know why mi stopped A series)5. Hardware and performance (6.5/10) -  SD 778 G for this price i bought is really worth it..  But it's good for above average gaming..  Can't push for a long time..  Sti I'm rating only 6.5 coz of some reasons -  since the phone is very light and thin,  xiaomi has compromised some things -  i think there's no vapour chamber for heat dissipation. Phone gets hot within 30 mins of gameplay of Real Cricket 20 then imagine for BGMI or COD.  So if you are a gamer,  don't buy this phone..  But for video rendering it's doing well.6. Software (9/10) -  You'll be shocked to see 9 out of 10 rating for software in a MI phone. The reasons were -  While installing the phone i turned all ads off.  As soon as my phone got booted,  I used Universal Debloater Tool from my PC and uninstalled all the bloatware apps..  After this I get the best user experience in a MI phone... Software is really fantastic after that..  Only very few bugs are there in MIUI which you'll rarely notice7. Speakers (8.5/10) - Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support you'll get better sound output but both the speakers are not equally balanced.  But for media experience it is really good.Overall experience (8/10)If you are a casual gamer and looking for a thin and lightweight phone and you'll mostly use your device for media experience -  definitely go for this",Best lightweight phone with few bugs,4.0 out of 5 stars

"I'm very happy and satisfied with this phone. It looks very beautiful and premium. I just love it. I like it's everything, it's prformance, smoothness, screen, camera, sound. I was looking for a slim and ligh 5G phone and it's more than my expections. Everything is superb. Battery back up is also good as it's 4250 MAH. It's fast recharge with 33wt is very good and I feel it's more than enough for anyone. I find this device, complete in all aspects . It's a superb 5G phone with HDR and 4K recording with 12 bands, it's with NFC too (if u feel NFC feature would be helpful for you now and in future) And dual speakers with dolby sound, what I was seaching badly in a slim light weight phone. Sound is also loud n clear. This is the only n only 5G mobile available in the market with all above features at this price. There is not any other in competition but  inspite of that it's perfect. I'm totally happy n satisfied and not find any cons till now since using last week. Highly recommended whose requirements are similar to mine. This is the only phone in this segment. For me it's a wow ! Amazing product at Amazon. Thanks. Superb, awesome phone, highly recommended for those whose requirements are as mine. Its deaserve for full 5 ⭐",Ultra slim n lightest 5g mobile.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have been using this phone for 2 weeks now. And I have to say I was pretty skeptical after reading all the reviews about this thing heating up, battery life and camera is poor. Well I can confirm at least one of these things is wrong. The phone heated up quickly after turning it on right out of the box and I was quite scared. But after installing the two updates, 1 600MB update to MIUI 12.5.5 and another update to MIUI 13.0 the heating issue dropped almost entirely. I can confirm it doesn't heat up during regular using like watching content on youtube (I watched hours and hours of it, still no heating issue) or while on calls for a long time. This phone is great for watching content, the colours are brilliant but the HDR is not. I will get back to it. One thing I cannot confirm is the gaming side. I don't play games and cannot say anything about gaming performance and battery during gaming. So keep that in mind. Now about the HDR. Its bad. There are ""black crush"" issues in low light. Like for example in low light conditions the picture gets distorted along the black bars on side while watching content. But it's nothing major and completely livable as it can be corrected by lowering the display brightness. Also this issue is software based and or hardware based on poor quality of display panel used to reduce costs. So I don't think it's repairable. Camera is poor, in sense that it is very unimpressive for a 29000 rupees phone. But I got this phone for 16k after exchange offer and bank offers so I am not bothered. But I do recommend using GCam port from third party providers as it wastly improves the quality of the camera.Overall I love this phone because I wanted a phone which is very light on the hand but also quite capable and has good battery life. With moderate usage I get around an entire day, morning to bed time. I got the snowflake white colour which is quite dazzling and unique. So if you think you can relate to me from my review, definitely consider this phone too. This is a great day to day phone. Also check out moto edge 30, a very similar phone but slightly better it seems.","Great phone, a bit expensive.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Got 2 of these beast 8 GB + 128 GB variant on exchange offer. 5000 + 5000 i.e. 10 k off.Pros:1. It is very light weight. Girls will love it as they can carry in their small bag.2. 10 bit AMOLED screen is very good. Content consumption friendly.3. 5 G ready4. Xiaomi camera app, lots of options, movie mode and filters.5. Very good haptic feedback6. Camera quality is good, check dxomark review. Video is very stable with steady mode. Selfie camera is also good. Low light photos are good if night mode is on.7. Battery life and management is good. Screen in time around 6 hrs. Easily lasts for 1.5 days of heavy use.8. Fingerprint sensor is fastCons:1. MIUI is not so good. Have to disable lot of extra features.2. Always on display is available but takes 1-2% battery every hour, so disabled it.3. Black crush issue in low light video viewing. It looks to be common issue across AMOLED displays. Need to increase screen brightness to fix it.4. Not for heavy gaming5. Need to be careful while fiddling with settings and installing apps. If not then wake lockup issue occurs and battery drains like crazy. So no side loading, please.6. Alexa built in is useless. First it drains battery. Secondly it doesn't here ALEXA call. Disabled it.The phone is good if you don't spend time on MIUI itself, instead get on with your daily APPs. If you start fiddling with alexa or super wallpaper or display settings, then battery drain or other issues can be seen.Overall quite satisfied with this purchase.Amazon exchange process was smooth, no issue.Thanks",Travel phone,5.0 out of 5 stars

Not apt for gaming, photos, general use.*Battery Life* : Battery is discharging even if you use it or not, it is giving a charge time of around 7-9 hrs and charging speed is good. Full charge will only take 40 mins. Not a great battery performance.*Good Interface*: I don't understand why is Google's phone, Google's messaging apps are included and given. I would prefer miui, which is very very better than Google's.*Camera*: Camera is average. Okay for a general user, selfie is fine not good, back cam is actually good and modes also shows some differnece. But clarity and photo pixels are not so clear.*Display*: Not a great display, you will find dark areas as some patches while watching anything. Colours are vivid and smooth.

Multitasking is not possible because it refreshes app every time you open it from recents making payments very unreliable.I have experienced 50+ UPI payment failure on Flipkart etc as they redirect to UPI apps and by the time you are back the payment window gets refreshed.3. The battery is pathetic. The management is pathetic. I barely get 3-4 hours of screen on time charging is bad. Takes 1 hour to fully charge and barely lasts 3-4 hours.By the time i finish writing this review it went from 40 to 38 with power saving mode on.The display is not even on 90hz it's 60.4. The phone lags and heats a lot. I am barely using it right now but it's hot as an oven and it's not even summer. It's 20° outside.5. The display is cheap. It is OLED but has grey images displayed in square heaps when watching a movie where scenes are dark. It's a nightmare to watch the Batman (2021) on this display as it has grey patches all over.6. Overall a useless phone as we can't multitask well and the battery doesn't last. The camera is not worth clicking a lot of photos and phone is not that smooth.Oh the battery is now 37%.Don't buy.The only decent thing is looks and speakers.

"I am writing review after using 50 days of this phone. The smoothness of UI and Camera quality was execellent of this phone and also includes a 10 bit display it makes super cool. Here I am really with MIUI because first time to use it and that makes very smooth and clean. But I add one thing that is Battery department. The battery department was poor lasting approximately half of a day if you are heavy user but you are a normal user then it comes 12-15 hrs. But surprisingly brand give a 33 wat charger in box and it charges full in 1 hour 10 mins which is good. The design of phone quite good but build with totally plastic material. Phone was really light weight and compact. Now a day..Is this phone can buy or not ?My answer is Yes, you can buy this phone under 20k or less best value for money but only recommended for normal user not for heavy user.So this is my full review of this phone.Thank you for reading my review.",Excellent product by Xiaomi.

"Update:After 5 month of usage and being a Poco F1 fan, i can say that this mobile is a piece of shit, just stay away.Software is buggy.Mobile becomes very slow at 80% memory full, it becomes unusable.First review:I upgraded to Xiaomi 11 Lite NE 5G (6GB) from Poco F1.I felt this is a better model in terms of pricing vis-a-vis specs compared to MI 11x or MI 11x Pro, while later models do have a bit better processor and display. 11 lite worked for me.Now coming to the device experience, I will first start with cons:1. Full Screen Gestures cannot work with third party launchers!! (Poco F1 allowed it). Also, you would not be able to use any third party gesture apps to work with third party launcher (Bigger Issue). So now I end up using MI Launcher (where as I prefer Microsoft Launcher). I hope MI come out with software upgrade to solve this issue.2. No proximity sensor. It is desirable to have proximity sensor. I did knew it didn't have it, however I went ahead with the purchase.3. No infra red face recognition. May be issue during the night.4. Third party apps accessibility is an issue. Doesnt work properly. For example MacroDroid is not working efficiently due to ""Not working"" error in Downloaded Apps accessibility. (Needs urgent attention by MI).5. Call recording is not announced (makes the feature unusable!!)Now coming to Pros:1. Amoled Screen is good in color reproduction (compared with Poco M3 and Motorola G5 5g). (Not Display Mate+)2. Smooth operation, no lag.3. Louder sound then Poco F1.4. NFC (most important, I needed this).5. Very light and Slim mobile (I don't like heavy mobiles)It has a side finger print sensor, it would have been a better if it had an onscreen FP Sensor. But no, regrets.Most of the Cons are for power user except proximity sensor. So if you are looking for best value for money, it is still a very good mobile.",Feature deterioration over Poco F1 (3 year old model),1.0 out of 5 stars

"Honest review better to buy a nokia 1100 instead of it.I purchased this phone in the end of january just after the launch to use it as primary phone along with my note 8 pro as secondary phone.This phone has good screen quality, Mordarate sound and camera and a buttery processor but the biggest problem I am facing right now is, this phone can do miracles but can't work as phone with a call feature.Problems1. Proximity sensor: guys this phone is not containing proximity sensor. Whenever the screen touch ear miscellaneous apps will open, your call will be hold automatically or muted and even accidentally dial the random contacts during the call. its annoying like a hell during important phone calls.2. Network: The phone is having a enough numbers of 5G bands but unfortunately 5G will take another 5 years for India and till then technology will upgrade and this phone will be outdated but for basic 3G and 4G this phone is having a drastic network issues. You have to struggleI for it. tried various networks like jio, airtel, vodaphone-Idea and even BSNL but facing pathetic network issues in this phone, which is not being experienced in my 2 years old secondary phone with the same network and at the same location.This phone is good to use as tablet but hell lot of options available in the market in the same budget and better specifications with a bigger screen. Not suitable for rigorous gaming also because of the comparatively smaller screen although processor and chipset is powerful enough for it. I think manufacturers developed it well but they forgot in the middle that primarily this device has to work as phone with a satisfied call features.In my opinion it's total waste of money, I am just waiting for Amazon to list it in the exchange list, so that I can be able to buy any good phone.",Worst phone ever used....

"Long Post alert!I have been an avid user of Xiaomi phones. So was my family. But purchase of 5G Lite NE was disastrous. The phone started acting up within few weeks of purchase. It will slow down and not respond, try to reboot and its gone. It will not turn on no matter what you do. Tried recovery mode, put on charger, absolutely nothing works. You will have to wait 6 to 8 hours and it will turn on. This was the first occurrence, I was traveling and since it started working normally I thought it fixed itself. A week gone by same thing phone slowed down tried to restart, gone! Again it was not accessible for 6 to 8 hours and turned back on. This time it worked for 3 to 4 days and again same thing. So instead of restart I thought i will switch off and turn back on. But same thing, it was gone. So this time took to xiaomi service centre, after brief investigation they told me the main board needs replacement and will take 10days to arrive. I asked its a new phone can I get replacement? They said no! After 7 days I get a call the phone is ready, finally thinking my odds have come to an end, I visit the service centre to find out they did not replace the mainboard but the power switch was faulty! It was hard to believe as the switch was perfectly fine. The ordeal begun to restore the phone with my all my apps, just face the same issue again! The phone stoped working and trying to reboot the phone died again.For 15 days I am without a phone and xiaomi does not care a bit to replace the phone quickly. They keep on telling part is awaiting.Please save yourself and do not buy Xiaomi. Thanks!",The most horrendous purchase ever!,1.0 out of 5 stars
"The screen display has the pixelated flickering issues. Most of it is in the upper half part of the full display. The elements in display looks out of shape (pixelated) with differenct contrast then its surrounding. This makes looking at the phone while watching pictures, videos and games a nighmare. A very sad and depressing experience so far. I waited for 5 years to buy a new phone and this happens to me. On top of bad display, Camera is shuttering while recording any type of video after 3-4 sec of recording.AMAZON INDIA! why would you send me a cheap, defective product??

"Edit april 2022: after android 12 update, this phone has become total junk. Camera app lags so much, it takes couple of minutes to take photo. It judders and drops frames so much that it's almost unusable. Calling app is another one, it hangs frequently while calling or when phone is ringing, takes 4 5 seconds to pickup the call. This is probable the worst phone I have ever used, a real downgrade from note 8 pro.Edit feb 2022: Phone has performance issues as well. After 10 minutes of gaming, phone gets really warm and gets choppy. Performance becomes very bad after 5-10 minutes. I won't recommend this phone. Rather increase your budget and get one plus nord 2Phone has display issue. It has vertical stripes of bright and dark areas which are more pronounced with solid color wallpaper. This is a big negative, and there are so many users reported similar issues with the display.Camera is good, like 6/10. Battery is also good, it is a full day battery with moderate use. Charging speed is not excellent, but good enough. Its slim and light, looks premium. Doesn't have headphone jack, but dongle is provided inside the box with OK quality.

**note::when ever you come to home from an app using swipe up gesture it will show some loading animation it happens atleast 5times a day this will make u through the phone.it starts to get warm using only Amazon.This started happening a lot after Android 12 update I suggest not to buy xiaomi phones in this budget. Go to realme it is more stable. Using realme gt master edition also. Camera app stuters a lot and battery life is very bad it should be better it means it is not optimised.The phone is slim and lite. I am casual user . I don't play games on phone. Just use for social media and calls.Cons:Battery back up is good not great with moderate usage it will get through a day.Battery drain at night is very less with battery saver on. 1-2percent.Phone is decent in every category.This phone heats badly for scanning the document.Playing bgmi for 10-15min will warm your phone.My Amazon music /podcast stop when I open another app like google news so frustrating I like to read news while listening songs.This particular phone has lot of issues with regular apps.My mom's 8k phone handles Amazon music better.It's takes decent video also but the camera app just hangs the phone so download third party cam app.,The phone software is buggy after update,1.0 out of 5 stars

They are selling the product with a different display in India. And that's definitely not a true 10 bit display. Even the redmi note 10 pro have a better display. I have checked with the 10 bit video files and the 8bit OnePlus display shows better colour reproduction and contrast. Seems like the ppi is in between 250 to 300. And probably they give a different version for youtubers so don't fall in youtube reviews. If you are looking for a good display phone for media experience skip this one. If you are looking for your second phone with 12 5g band support and decent mid range performance and slim light weight phone go for it. Only if you get it below 20k. I purchase it as a spare phone and got the 8gb variant below 20k that's why not returning it.,Sold with a low quality display varient in India. Poor display,1.0 out of 5 stars

Imagine trying to copy the OTP from a msg and when you go back to the page to enter it, it reloads! Haven't seen a worse phone than this. Extremely poor RAM management. Typing/Keyboard isn't smooth, camera hangs everytime you open the camera app plus camera quality is poor, battery drains extremely fast, calling problems. My old phone works better than this. Their Customer Care is a joke, so good luck trying to get this faulty device exchanged. Final verdict - Avoid buying this. Go for anything else other than this phone.",Do not buy,1.0 out of 5 stars
"UPDATE after 1 yearThe power button went bad, the screen had started protruding out which I got glued at some shop. After working for 4 months the phone died without any warnings. It's out of warranty so the repairs are gonna cost us.The quality of MI phones have gone down significantly, please avoid these chinese phones in general as they are poorly built. I should have learned my lesson after Mi A1.Old review:It is super light and has good camera quality in terms of color accuracy with good detail. But the real MVP here is the OS, the MIUI on this phone is very minimal. There was close to no bloatware on this phone and overall felt snappy. On top of that it bundles 3 OS updates and 4 years of security updates. Mi phones have the premium factor and this does possess it.",PHONE DIED AFTER 18 MONTHS,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Camera is main highlight of every smarphone. I purchased xiaomi 11 lite ne 5g and my camera experience with this phone is very bad, both front and rear cameras are bad. They both takes saturated, warm toned and less details photos. Battery life (4250 mah) is 5-6 hrs and even charging speed is very slow, it takes around 1.5 hrs to full charge that should be not more than 1 hr. Processor is average, you can't play bgmi at high settings. It disappointed me totally. We do not expect this type of issue under 25k smarphone. This is overpriced phone. It's price should not be more than 20k. Xiaomi, pls fix these camera issues and work on picture post processing. Overall not a worth buy. If you want to buy a camera centric phone then go for Oppo, Vivo, Samsung, or Realme smarphone.

"The phone is beautiful and great to hold, especially with the thin profile. The screen is also decent and the cameras in the right lighting do take decent shots. But the core issue with this phone is the network issues, this phone just is not able to sustain any network consistently. Even phone networks that work flawlessly on other devices keep fluctuating with their signal strength, signal quality and signal type. I have tried Jio, Airtel & Vodafone in the last 9 months, all with similar issues but especially so with Jio. Being a phone, if it can't make calls reliably it's an abject failure.

Even it can't beat my 2 years old realme XT in gaming and camera. Poor upgrade choice. Battery backup is also very less.

"So long story short, I purchased this phone and the unit I received had a display panel issue known as ""black crush"", I was very disappointed that a Phone that's having its Display Panel as it's USP is having this issue.So I applied for a replacement, and after many painstaking days of follow-up with Amazon I got my replacement.But to my disappointment the replacement phone also has a weird panel issue, wherein, in low brightness you can see faint black lines running down the panel.But now I'm tired of applying for replacements and I don't know if the replacement would have an another major defect bigger than this one.So my verdict for this phone would be is that Xiaomi's build quality is becoming more and more questionable these days as they keep on churning out more mobiles than a rat has babies each year.I don't think my next phone would be a Xiaomi.",Questionable build quality is how I'd describe my experience with this phone,2.0 out of 5 stars

I fall in the trap and bought this phone.Primary reason was 3 years android update and 4 years security update, which is a very good promise as per todays security requirements as our dependability on mobile is increasing day by day.Camera performance is quiet average,night mode is ok. 64 MP mode is again OK.Fingerprint reader is again ok.so many times 3-4 attempts required to open the phone.No doubt Phone is quiet fast to operate,but i think UI of realme is more user friendly.Hidden space to hide things is also required.","below average camera,average finger print reader, Fast performance",2.0 out of 5 stars

"The best feature of the phone is; it's featherweight. But ironically it's featherweight in all departments. The cameras are substandard, the display is average, and the battery doesn't last long. The price tag is quite high for a phone that literally cannot punch above its weight. My M31S has a far superior display and cameras. There are several things about this phone which are admirable. Qualcomm 778G processor allow fast competition of tasks. Finger print sensor response is also fast. The phone is definitely not going to break aging wrists. With the supplied silicon case, the phone looks nice from the front, though the back looks weird.

Camera is super pathetic. Can't get any worse. Especially the rear camera.One main lesson learnt don't trust YouTube reviews. Most are sellouts.

Average fast charging. Enough for me. ~70 min to full charge.Cons:1. Camera. I didn't like the image processing. Too much saturation. Needs a lot of improvement here.2. Bettery life: You expect at least 5000 mAh from any premium phone. I understand the tradeoff  being the slimmest. But personally I would prefer a larger battery.3. MIUI: I am not a fan of expensive phones. But based on my previous experiences with ColorOS and Vanilla Android, I believe this stands nowhere. A lot of bugs and slightly bad UX. This is not perticular to this model rather across XIOMI phones.4. Missing in-screen unlock feature.For me camera and battery life are ranked top most crucial features fome me in phones.

"I am writing this review after using phone for around six months. In terms of looks and design, phone looks great. Using this phone has exposed the reality of hypes created by xiaomi to buy its somewhat useless product. Xiaomi advertised as 10 bit Amoled and Dolby Vision support for Netflix but these are either not usable or not existing at all. Being a phone with Amoled Display, I was expecting it to be True ALWAYS ON DISPLAY as shown in other Amoled phones of brands such as Samsung, Oneplus, Realme but here again Xiaomi cheated us and it can remain only for 10 seconds. Moreover, Xiaomi boasts of several long exposure modes but modes such as Light painting, Starry sky, Star trails etc cannot be used without a tripod. Xiaomi should have clearly written this in the product description rather than highlighting these modes to make people buy the product. After all this experience, I am not going to buy this THIRD CLASS Chinese brand phone ever again.",Hype by Xiaomi,3.0 out of 5 stars
Pros:1. Light weight. ( I mean literally too light)2. 12 band 5g. So future secured for atleast 3 years.3. Decent camera setup. Stabilizer available at 4k recording and decent quality for micro photography.5. Type C to 3.5mm convertor cable provided in the box as no 3.5mm jack available.6. Good stereo speakers.7. Processor is decent if not mind blowing.8. Amoled screen is awesome.Cons:1. BATTERY is pathetic for this price. Should have given atleast 5000mah.2. Front Camera could have been better.3. Ultra wide cencor could've been better.4. 33w charger provided in the box. Was expecting 64w for this price.5. Maximum refresh rate is 90Hz. Should have been 120Hz.6. Pocket dial is a major issue.7. Placement of finger sensor is pathetic. Should have been at the rear or on the screen.

"This phone suffer from black crush issue u won't notice in the day time usage but its more apparent in the night time while watching movie or videos or even wallpaper with dark pattern.Disappointed ☹️☹️Everything is perfect except the display.My friend bought this same device he was also facing this same issue.Even the replacement unit also have this issue.From 0 to 50% brightness this cheap display produces dark red tint on all the colors.From 51 to 100% it produces actual colour.Don't trust the Xioami's 1Billion colors display this display doesn't even gives accurate color at low brigtness.It interprets black as dark brown at low brightness scenarios.Seems company know the issue thats why they giving offers to clear up the stocks.😖Those who are interested on this phone, if you are buying this to watch Netflix or any other ott don't go for this unless u are die hard fan of Mi.Camera is good.Battery gives more than one day on normal usage.Performance is great.",Good phone with poor display😒,3.0 out of 5 stars

Packaging was awful no bubble wraps or anything..it was just the box inside the package..Coming to the phone.. i wanted a phone that has everything balanced..it has nice cameras... adequately fast i.e. comparable to sd855/860 devices acc. to geekbench & antutu scores..90hz display is a balanced approach...as to make the phone slim the battery is 4250mah...bt battery is also good...i expeceted it will be pathetic bt even while keeping 90hz always on its still awesome...To some up its a phone for someone who want everything snappy and don't wanna compromise on any aspect..Coming to consThe display panel used is a 'Tianma' panel which has a flaw of hazy texts..and there is also the famous amoled screen problem i.e. color gradient issue... Rather than these two i didn't find any flaw...if u are not a keen observer you may not notice the difference but when you keep the phone beside another phone you would notice the texts are a bit hazy...Overall a good phone...,Gorgeous design with a balanced phone,3.0 out of 5 stars
"Fingerprint reader stops responding several times a day and phone hangs a lot every now and then, even when 3 GB of RAM is available for use.This started happening a lot after 30 days of use. Although this problem is there from the day 1 itself but it is now making me start to hate this phone as it is more frequent now and even after a targeted update (specifically to fix System Launcher hanging problem) the problem is still the same. Every app struggles to open and I have to clear the running apps 5-6 times before the app loads properly and that too gets resolved after 7-8 mins only.I used ""Redmi Note 4"" for 3 years before upgrading and that phone was far better than this piece of crap, although that phone ended up having the same problems before its END OF LIFE.Won't ever buy XIAOMI or REDMI again..I am done with these Chineese brands.",Hangs a lot after 30 days,3.0 out of 5 stars

"I cannot say much about the phones performance or anything. It does the job exceptionally.Purchased for my wife, on an average her daily usage lasts for about 2 hours. With such an usage it may not be wrong to say that the phone is mostly on standby mode throughout the day. It lasted for 2 days 48 hours with the battery at 9 percent when I put it to charge.Camera is awesome.its much better than my 8T.The only issue I noticed was with whatsapp. While restoring the media it was stuck at 100 percent throughout. I changed the phone because of that issue but it happened with the new phones as well. Eventually Googled and found the issue primarily lies with whatsapp. The don't accept it that it's their issue. Anyways with tips from Google I was able to solve that issue on my own (lol whatsapp should pay me for tech support).All in all an excellent purchase",Whatsapp Back up issue,3.0 out of 5 stars
Pros: 1. Light. 2. Thin. 3. Size fits average male palm well. 4. MIUI good. 5. RAM management goodCons: 1. Flash light very dim; not at all good for the torch. 2. Camera ok but colours not real. 3. Night photography is not good  4. Didn't receive OTP messages in MS SMS app; you have to use default google message app which has so many lags & imperfections. 5. Some calls are not received. Caller gets the MSG that my phone is switched off whereas it's not.Verdict: good if you get it in 15k range with exchange of old phone. Not worth if you buy it for 24k or 26k.,Good but expensive as it's not great,3.0 out of 5 stars

As of now camera performance is just ok and not as expected. Hope that camera performance will be improved by software updates by xioami. In my 3 days usage battery last for one day only on very moderate usage. Under heavy usage like shooting photos, videos, video streaming, little gaming, battery last for 4 to 5 hours only.

"After using for a month writing this review, phone valuation is bad, this phone should be valued for 20k only. It has worst sensor effect. During call the display comes up when there is a little movement also. Auto call recording facility not available. Too good Camera quality. Better battery backup. Very light phone. Nice display. It's better than average phone but not value phone. Need to work on internal application.",Average Phone,3.0 out of 5 stars

Picture quality is not up to the mark.... Details are missing.... Even the day light pictures are missing the details.... Very worst quality from 25k budget phone...Didn't expected this from Xiaomi.Don't go for this phone if you are expecting a good camera.YouTube videos get stuck all of sudden where as the audio plays in the background...Made a mistake buying this phone during the sale....,Worst camera....

"Even though this mobile in launched in 2021 in price range of 25k+. This is still an best mobile phone in 2022 under 20k price. This design of the mobile gives an premiem look. And weight is very light. Camera quality is really good in this price range. And it comes with dolby vision super amoled screen, which makes it really good for watching videos.

"When I take a mobile,  Xiaomi 11lite ne 5g has very lite weight, camera quality also very good.One major issue that it comes with inbuilt Alexa, but it not working properly it takes too much of time to response, in same time Google assistant working good.I shared complait with Mi and Alexa team, mi I feel bad experience with mi they give poor solution to take mobile with nearest service center,Alexa team working little better they complaint with trouble shooting.More important I feel a premium in my hand while using Xiaomi 11 lite ne 5g",Best 5g mobile,4.0 out of 5 stars
"TBH, the mobile is absolutely good. I feel camera post processing algorithm and battery management can be improved. However, nothing is too bad in this. Also, sometimes I face proximity sensor issues during call. I think it's because of display. If the camera portion of display is placed near ear then there's no issue with Sensor. However, I mostly use TWS so it's not a deal to me. I bought this just because I can use more than 2 years. Network reception is good and video and audio is good. Some people experience tint issue. I didn't face this issue. I bought in February.",Alrounder!,4.0 out of 5 stars
"It's a good flagship like experience at a a mid range price, loved the display quality even though the 10bit is not effective in all areas and 90Hz seems fine unless someone with 120Hz uses it.The camera is also best in class with M52 and A52 being the only competition. The only problem is battery, I'm a heavy user and the 4250 battery falls short for the 90Hz display. Also wish there was some way to use the NFC nothing about the phone thoughAttaching photos of Macro, night mode and 10x zoom moon shot to get a glimpse of the camera's ability",All good but the battery,4.0 out of 5 stars
After one month uses I have written this reviewPros:-1) Better display2) Decent battery3) Amazing form factor extremely light weight and stylish.4) Comes with screen protector and case. Also provide 3.5mm adopter.5) Good quality sound.6) Good camera and their interface options.Cons:-1) Camera little bit laggy in videos and sharpness level not meet when you zoom image.2) Proximity sensor not doing there job well some times it work some times just woke screen in the middle of call.Overall a very good value for money product if u get it under 18-19k in exchange offer otherwise go to samsung and oneplus it's justify there price of 25-26k.Hope this review will be helpful to all.,Above average in Mid range phones,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Actually a good phone . Light weight , Slim , and handy . But the battery backup not so good as expected . Even if we consider it has only a 4250mah battery but it also comes with an Amoled display . So the battery backup must be a quiet impressive . And sometimes some glitches from the software side .

"The phone build and design was pretty good and Xiaomi delivered a good quality with design. Next the display was the highlight in this phone Amoled screen with 10bit was top notch but they should've given 120hz but 90 hz does a better job.The camera was very good, it pops out the real colour in day light condition. But there is some issue with night mode, maybe in future updates they may fix that. But the bitter part is battery life, the fast charging was too good but the battery performance is not that good, I am an ex redmi note 7 pro user it has only 4000 mah battery but the battery life was good, even Mi 11 lite ne 5G has 4250 mah but the battery is not that good, plz Mi give some updates and sort out battery issues.",Mi 11 lite NE 5G review,4.0 out of 5 stars

It was bang for bucks for me.I exchanged it with my oppo a7 with  fully cracked screen for 6900.I don't think I will get a better offer than this.Some issues I felt was battery backup is not so good. But charge fast though.When using wifi doesn't get max speed. But cannot find it when using normaly. But when testing speed and downloading it seems much slower than my other devices. Heard that was miui issue and miui 13 will fix the issue.On general use phone doesn't heat up that much. But when gaming it became worse. Can't complaint that because it is that much slimmer and doesn't meant for hardcore gaming.Anyway I'm happy with the purchase.,Got it for 19300 after exchange,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Ok so I went for this phone after spending a lot of time researching the 25K range. Here is my review after two weeks.Best things -Design - slim, light weight and feel good in hand.3 year of updates for Android.Smooth performance.Good -Surprisingly Camera is good. It's best in natural light, ok ok in night. But overall it's better than other old MI phonesBattery and charging- very fast charging and keeping the slim size in mind battery last full day.Bad -UI is not that great. For example the dark mode hides a lot text etc in some apps. Hope it get better with updates.Conclusion - buy if you are looking for a all rounder phone. Consider other options if you are looking for only camera or only gaming phones.",Great design - review after 2 week of use,4.0 out of 5 stars
Fingerprint is good.Battery life is also good if you are decent user.(like I am descent user so it gives me more or on average 1½ day usage. Although battery life is good. Better than expected as it has 4000mah aproxx.)Camera is also good but it can be better more at this price range.Performance is good. You'll not face any issues.In terms of Looks it is good and very thin and light weight as company claims.Overall phone is very good. If a bit camera would be better then it will be excellent.Review after 3 months of usage.,Best Phone in this price,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Been using this for last 1.5 month. Here's my review:- Performance is ok. Could have been more snappy.- Dissapointing battery life.- Camera can't beat samsung, it's better than other mi phones.- There are still 2-3 bugs I've seen after latest update.- Display is good.- Sound is good.- Lookwise it's a head Turner. Many people have asked me which phone this is.- Price can be justified around 23k, I got it for 21k in diwali sale when it was a newly launched model.- It's super light and feels very comfortable in hand.",Good product but dissapointing battery life,4.0 out of 5 stars

It's very light weight and slimmest device i have ever used of MI brand. Battery life is very good. Camera is also good very easy to carry and operate.Only thing I want to complain about is its transparent cover given with the phone is getting yellow very early. Toughen glass should be given instead because its perfect fit toughen glass is not available in market.No hands free with the phone.,Value for money handset... you can go for it.,4.0 out of 5 stars
The phone looks great with good hardware. But the software is full of bugs . When the phone works it performs smoothly but when the bug shows up it lags and hangs. Camera quality is excellent apart from the ultra wide which is mediocre. A good software experience would have made the phone experience much better. And the software of the phone is a major cons,Average,4.0 out of 5 stars
"The phone will definitely give u a flagship feeling for the price paid. I got it on bank discount at twenty one thousand. Impressed by the camera setup, better than Iqoo7 (which I returned). Battery is fine, not impressive, but can't complain.Cons: 1) display is natural and vibrant but lacks subtle sharpness. You won't feel it in daily usage but u can notice it easily if you try to. 2) speakers are loud but not as loud as expected (because of the slimmer size), compared to iqoo7.",Good value if on sale,4.0 out of 5 stars

The phone is really of good quality for this price.. I got it on a discount sale for 21k. Battery life is ok.. Small battery but lasts an entire day with heavy use.. Selfie camera is really great.

"It's been 2 weeks I'm using this and here is my quick review on it-- 90hz feels great. Just eats more battery but it's worth the experience.- I've seen no lags till date. Maybe because I've debloated few of the apps.- Battery runs for a day on all day usage. So that's great.- Fingerprint reader and Face unlock is very fast.- Camera isn't great. During night it feels like using a 10K android device. Since I'm not a photogenic person so that's ok for me.In short, except camera this device is absolutely perfect in everything.",Camera not that great.

"Pros is it's camera, both front and rear are awesome. Also, lightweight phone feels good to carry. Gives premiere look when in hands.Cons is it's fingerprint sensor is on awkward position due to which its difficult to unlock phone however you can use face unlock or passcode but still fingerprint sensor should be in display. Also, battery life is for 1 day if using it throughout the day like I do because of office work but that can be overlooked with its fast charging adaptor.

"Good sleek and light phone, holding this phone feels great in the hands. Not much bugs in the UI. The screen quality is so good that it beats my iPhone 12 in colours and accuracy, 90 Hz refresh rate feels almost as smooth as 120 Hz. The processor is very powerful for day to day tasks, never felt any lags or jitters in multitasking. Didn't try gaming though, because didn't buy it for gaming purpose.Battery gets you through a day of usage easily, and the 33w charging feels gives you additional power if needed in very quick time.Call quality on this phone is superb!! HD audio and the earpiece is so loud you can hear the caller properly in the middle of loudest possible traffic! That is something i missed even in iPhone 12, that nearly costs thrice this phone.It's a great phone if bought under 20k. We got it for 18500 including the exchange offer and card discount, at that price it's the best you can get honestly.This phone didn't get much popularity, because xiaomi keeps coming with new models each month, but this is better than all other phones in this range. Go for it without a doubt!",Great phone at unbeatable price! Sleek and lite.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"After a week now,i can sum up the things as follows:1.The looks are definitely gorgeous.2.The camera may not be the best, but for this segment you will hardly get any better. Both the Photography and videography is good,photos are crisp,videos are stable,there are so many director modes u can play with.3.Display is colorful,touch feels smooth too.4. Stereo speakers deliver perfect sound.5.No heating issues even while playing high graphic games like Codmobile,the gaming and visuals feel really crisp and sharp as u can see from the clip.6. Running on Android 12,no issues so far,no lag no crashing no black screen..Selfie camera is ok,not bad not good either.Battery drains faster at 90hz refresh rate,but being 4250mah,it delivers surprising performance.If you compare this phone to other mid-range phones, OnePlus - heats while gaming,the processor isn't as efficient as sd778,and costs a bit higherSamsung - A52,costs a bit higher and videos aren't as stable as this one,camera might be better but u don't have director modes in that.Overall i can say considering a perfect balance of every feature at this price,this phone rocks....",Best phone in this price range!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars
"In this day & age of 6.67 inches 7 inches 200 gms devices, this device makes your phone usage satisfying due to comparatively small screen size and ultralight weight.Even though its only 158 gms but the build quality is top notch with many color options.The 4250 mah battery is good enough to carry you through a typical day with moderate to heavy use.Cameras are nothing outstanding but gets the job done quite well if you are not a photography person and takes casual photos and videos now and then.Dislay quality is top notch with 10 bit display and it supports HD playback in Netflix prime video etc. Xiaomi could have given 120hz but then battery life would have suffered, so good they didn't.Speakers is another great feature of this device. The sound from the speaker is both loud and has bass. At higher volumes also the sound doesn't distorts or breaks.Xiaomi has done a good thing by providing type c to 3.5 mm adapter in the box.Charging takes 55 mins to from 5 to100%.All in all its a unique device that has all rounder capabilities and its for those who good of everything and not for those who want best in one/some departments.

"Honest review after 2 weeks of usage:First of all, No complaints about the phone. It's simply outstanding. Good battery backup, easily lasts for a full day with heavy usage. The good things I liked are it's premium feel, elegant lightweight design(feels so light), Good camera setup captures great photos in daylight and decent photos in night, Smooth operation without any lags, no heating issues and 3yrs of promised OS upgrade. So overall a best buy!And now about cons: For some reasons, Amazon really screwed up on the delivery part and took almost 10 days to deliver it to me (perhaps I ordered for a next day delivery) and after multiple calls,chats and emails to cust care they literally gave up and I had to collect my order from their distribution center. On the wholesome it was a pathetic experience.",Value for money,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Have been hunting the phone for quite sometime which could replace my 3 year old Asus Zenfone 5Z. Explored Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite NE 5G (8GB RAM + 128GB), Samsung Galaxy M52 5G (8GB RAM + 128GB), Oppo Reno 6 5G (8GB RAM + 128GB) and One Plus Nord 2 5G (8GB RAM + 128GB). Let me be very precise and crisp with review. Hence, here are pros and cons.Pros:1. Slimmer (6.8 mm)2. Lighter (158 gm)3. Good front and rear camera quality4. Battery life is also good. With heavy use it lasts approximately 24-36 hours5. Classic build quality6. Hybrid slot for memory extension7.

"Been using the phone for a few months now, excellent experience so far both on the hardware and software front.Hardware - You will love the sleek and glassy finish. The frosted back makes the phone look more premium above it's price range. Display is top notch Amoled with good brightness. Speakers are decent and loud. Cameras are the best part! Loved the picture quality from all the cameras. Fingerprint reader is snappy and well placed. Front camera punch hole is small and well positioned.Coming to the software I'm using MIUI for the first time and I'm pleasantly surprised with the experience. Software is well refined. Got last month's security update as well. One noticable software issue is with the camera app! With such wonderful cameras, the camera app keeps freezing and crashing occasionally which is a big disappointment. When it works it does a fabulous job. Hope Xiaomi fixes the camera app issues in future updates.Overall a very well rounded, stylish and well specced phone. There is always some bank/card offer running. With exchange and card offer I got this at a great price making this a value for money purchase. Hope Xiaomi pushes Android 12 soon.",Slick and stylish!,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Awesome phone that has a perfect combo of everything, looks great, thin and light. The cameras are awesome, even the 2x zoom macro lens is excellent. No idea why people were complaining about the cameras, I loved it especially on Google Camera apps. SD 778G is a very good and modern SoC, with the cpu performance being at par with SD 855+ and even more efficient, although GPU performance is weaker (heavy gamers should stay away). The modem on this device performs very well, supports plenty of 4g and 5g bands and with good speeds and reception. Battery life is above average, not so good since I moved from a phone that had 6000 mah. The amoled display is pretty good, although 10 bit doesn't make any visible difference.

This product has a manufacturing defect of dead/stuck pixels on the display (blue subpixel always on even Mi booting logo), and Amazon service is by far the worst when it comes to resolving delivery related issues. The main culprit is the logistics department so the customers face the problem and get frustrated. Amazon should take the feedback of the delivery boy so that there is no problem with Amazon as well as the customer.",Display Issue Dead/Stuck Pixels,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I'll just divide this review in 2 parts pros and cons.Cons: Not noticed any apart from decent battery backup and lack of 3.5mm jack.Pros:• Compact size, easier for one handed use.• Lightweight, holding the phone for long hours of scrolling won't  give you pain.• Only the useful camera sensors are onboard, not the useless ones. Such as 2mp depth and 2mp macro.• Stereo speakers are loud enough.• performance is good enough as per a mid range phone.• 90hz display is a bliss, though I would have loved a 120hz one but 90hz is not bad.Will update soon another review after longtime usage.","Finding a compact and lightweight phone, then this one is for you!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Review after 3 months usage.Bought this phone with offer of 5k where the price took 22k and worth price for this money. However, For actual price 27k better opt to other models.Very light weight and much handy to use, especially for single hand users.Little bit issue in finger unlock as they are side mounted.Battery mAh could hv been added more as the display takes most of them. Using battery life mode all day to save the battery.Rear Camera looks good, especially macro. However, the auto focus to be stopped as they much don't allow you to take ur photo, you can see them in attached photos.Above all, main issue calls going to mute or some other applications gets opened while speaking over phone as the display gets ON due to movement of phone and with touch sensor it gets worked automatically",Budgeted phone worth for the discounted price,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Xiaomi has really worked on their MIUI. I never bought one because of their ad ful ui. But with this change, I am sure they are going to gain new customer base. No more fuzzy ads.Slim and easy to carry in a pocket. Battery is good but I wish they could have offered 5000 mah but then it would have increase the weight. Camera does it's job well especially super macro.One thing nobody talks about nowadays is the sole purpose of the phone i.e. the voice quality. It is superb you can only hear the recipient's voice clear and crisp. no noisy background to disturb your convo.Overall one can take it without hesitation.",Budget dhamaka,5.0 out of 5 stars
I mainly bought this due to its light weight compare to others. It has a frosted back glass so no fingerprint issue (but beware the back glass is not that scratch resistant) overall it looks good with a clear case. The screen is great for watching movies. The camera quality is good in this price segment. Also don't worry about the battery even if it has 4250mah its well optimised and lasts for a day or two for me of normal usage with 7+ hrs screen on time(no gaming). Overall it's a pretty good phone,Great lightweight 5g phone under 20k,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Purchased it with heavy discounts and great exchange deal. It is worth it.If you are not a gamer, this phone is perfect. It's light and feels premium. If you are a devoted gamer, I would suggest comparing all phones in your budget. I am a gamer and I still think this was a great buy.Being light and slim has its pros and cons. The cons are that it heats up in heavy gaming, especially in summers. Just sit near a fan and you are fine.The battery life is good but with heavy use, you have to be mindful of it.","Light, good midrange phone",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Writing this review after a month of usage. Love thr design and aesthetics of the device. Lightweight as advertised. Camera is too good for both outdoor and indoor clicks. Night mode is even greater. Doesn't lag anytime. I'm a lite user and doesn't do gaming of any sort. Hence the battery lasts for 2 days for me. Heavy Instagram user but still it lasts. Touch is responsive. Not sure why some say the camera is very bad and such. It's a nice phone and best fornthe price segment. The miui rocks as I like it since my poco m3.. Speaker Sound is loud. Haven't tried connected headset yet. But via Bluetooth, the quality is very good. Yet to explore more on this device.",Best buy,5.0 out of 5 stars
This phone from Xiaomi 5G series is a excellent choice in terms of powerful performance. As the name suggests Xiaomi Lite NE 5G is solid in terms of design and features. The 64MP camera quality is simply stunning and exceptional.The slimmest phone does the grand work when it comes to producing Dolby vision out of videos. The pictures seem larger than life in HD and add pure magic to absorb the visual elegance. All in all this phone provides all the pleasure in perfect ways to ride the experience of performance in cool avatar.,Lite Mobile Magnificent,5.0 out of 5 stars
One only thing about to say that if we heavily use it throughout the day then it's power won't last more than 8 hours. As I have experienced on my handsetCamera quality is ok but lacks sometime when low lightning conditions are there. So you would have to suffer for that.Also some plus points about this product be like it's feel like super light and feel like holding a pencil and paper in your hand. Touch is very responsive and smooth ui experience is available. 😘😗🥲🙂☺,Very slim and slippery also,5.0 out of 5 stars

"In this Range with 778G processor performance is better than Qualcomm Snapdragon750, 730,720 and close to SD865. Antutu score of  processor is good. Its very light phone. In this range it can be compared to Oppo F19 Pro+ 5G but i think it has more 5G bands available. IR blaster is bonus in Xiaomi brand. Look and feel of phone is good with black colour. Lite weight is impressive. It has no 3.5mm Jack but adaptor is provided in box for headphones. I have used only for 24hrs, Not observed any MIUI 12.5.4 bugs but OS is not as good as Oppo Color OS, 1+ Oxygen OS and Samsung One UI 3.1.

Every thing the company promises is there. The extra what they have given is a nuisance. I have noticed that the screen saver eats up allot of data and suddenly you will hear sounds coming from your phone (specially when you are busy doing something) and you lost your focus and take out your phone to see if you locked it properly. But thankfully they have given the option to turn that feature off as well. So thank you for a lovely phone and beautiful features.,So far so good. Almost a month of use.,5.0 out of 5 stars

"If you're looking for a phone under 30k primarily for content consumption then one plus Nord 2t is definitely one of the best options in its segment.DISPLAY - Absolutely in love with the smooth 90hz amoled display, colours are bright and vivid. The display coupled with its kick-ass set of speakers makes it a delight to watch high quality content on OTT platforms and YouTube.BATTERY & CHARGING - Comes with a 80w fast charger that charges the battery to 100% in less than 30 minutes and lasts a full day even with heavy usage.When in hurry, simply charge it for 10 minutes and you're good to go for the next 4-5 hours.GAMING -  I am not much of a gamer but from what i have seen, it handles gaming pretty well without any issues.HEATING - I was quite sceptical before buying Nord 2T given the notorious performance of its predecessor in this particular department. But looks like they have improved as I have not faced any major heating issues till now despite long sessions of heavy usage.CAMERA - The back camera is fantastic and performs pretty well in all kinds of lighting conditions. Pictures are well balanced with the right dose of saturation and contrast. Camera has night mode and ultra wide features as well.Now coming to the front camera, its a  HUGE LET DOWN. Perhaps the only thing in this phone that has disappointed me is Its front camera. I found the front camera performance to be very inconsistent and borderline terrible at times specially in indoor conditions. Don't buy this one if you take too many selfies.USER INTERFACE - Clean and crisp, without any bloatwares.We may not get ""the Classic Oxygen OS"" anymore but it's still oxygen OS and IMO it is far better than the UI experience provided by any of it's competitors.BUILD & DESIGN - The Nord 2T looks classy  and feels premium to the core. No arguments on this one.Overall, i am completely happy and satisfied with this phone's performance till now and I find it to be value for money at 29k!!!I believe every phone compromises somewhere or the other in this price range, just be sure about your requirements and make a decision accordingly.",A THING OF BEAUTY!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Things to consider if u r looking for it1. 90hz is very smooth in this phone - except Youtube - in every app you will see highr refresh rate UNLIKE iqoo (considering it the only competitor) where you will not see higher refresh rate anywhere except homescreen .2. heating issue - due to glass back every machine heats up - i have ip 11 and comparing to that this heats like NOTHING - so no heating ISSUES per se3. I think proximity sensor is not accurate but only sometimes , and also it feels like sometimes sound from earpiece is a little less4. games work like charm - although it is not for gamers - but it does a great job if you play for 2-3 hours daily5. Front camera feels like 2 MP when taking the shot - but in actuality a very capable camera sensor is provided - if you use Gcam just for front - you will see that the selfies are literally like PIXEL 6 Pro ( I know this is a big claim ) and back main sensor is LEGIT OP !6. Haptic feedback in my phone is really charming - very good - you will surely feel like holding a really premium phone for sure7. Ofcourse one of my main reason to buy this phone was good OS and built quality and despite bad OxygenOS reputation - It in reality is way too good than its competitors still.Be wise with your purchase DONT go blindly by the specs . thanks .",A Solid package in this Price segment - some practical points -,5.0 out of 5 stars
"New review: After the new update the battery life has increased drastically, thanks for that. However there are still some bugs, the photos can be better, lacks pure Android experience for which OnePlus was known.Old review: ""Almost nothing is good about this phone. O2 operating system is now CO2 Operating system. Automatic brightness is a feature from decades earlier yet you've still managed to mess this up. Again battery optimisation is the worst, Around 4 hours screen time. Camera is always over saturated and iso is always on the higher side. Background apps get closed so fast so multitasking is a no no, it straggles to keep up. System hang issue faced even in Android 12. Dimensity 1200 is better than Dimensity 1300, it's deceiving. Why did we pay around 29k for this phone? I mean 4k 60fps is now 4k 30fps? Really? One last recommendation, WORK ON THE SOFTWARE. This is not a stable software.""",My utmost request OnePlus/Oppo please get the battery optimisation sorted.,4.0 out of 5 stars

"I was looking for a new phone to replace my old one and I came across the OnePlus Nord 2T 5G on Amazon. I was intrigued by the jade fog color and the 5G capability, so I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by how fast the delivery was. I got the phone in just two days and it was well protected in a sturdy box. The phone itself is a beauty. It has a smooth and elegant design and a gorgeous jade fog color that changes with the light. The screen is large and clear, the camera is amazing and takes great photos and videos, and the performance is flawless and speedy. The phone also has a long-lasting battery and a super-fast charging feature that can fill up the battery in less than an hour. The phone is definitely worth every penny and it lives up to the OnePlus standard of quality and innovation. I love this phone and I’m so glad I bought it. It’s one of the best phones I’ve ever used and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a top-notch 5G smartphone at a reasonable price.",Amazing phone,4.0 out of 5 stars

"Though a good amount of time has passed by since it’s inception, OP Nord 2T proves a stable worker even now. At 60Hz Refresh Rate, the 2T runs a good length of 1.5 days constantly on Wifi connections. At 90, however, a sharp decline in Bty performance is seen. The length is just halved.No lags on the Software end, but definite throttle in terms of general performance is seen. Expect to get a relief on genuine updates.Speakers are not as good as other stereo ones around but can meet up routine requirements. They are loud and that’s all.Lenses are built for average requirements and the daily routine snaps are more than satisfactory. Not for professional purposes at all.YES .. should be loud n clear to OP that the Alert Slider is a boon and is the only such hardware utility in an Android phone , parallel to an IPhone. Of immense value.2T with an expandable memory option and a 3.5mm port will be an end- all option for many in India and will go out as a Hot Cake .. take it from me.Overall, 2T is reliable , sturdy enough, and an amalgamation of basic functionality features in a mid ranger smartphone.If someone is not willing to shell out in the range of 50 n 60k , this offering from OP will work wonders.Go for it.Amazon thanks for a prompt delivery of a genuine piece.

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1. No headphone jack. - I am not a fan of bluetooth earbuds2. The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button3. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.4. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.5. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.6. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever. So the first thing I did was to get a back-cover with rubbery finish.2.",An all-rounder phone with flagship features at an affordable price point,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I have used the OnePlus 3t earlier and was blown away by the experience. The features, the customisation ability, and everything was top notch. In fact OnePlus had the dark theme way before Android offically launched it for the Google pixel.Had this been some other xyz brand, I'd have been blown away, but since this is a OnePlus, I expected a lot more. Regarding hardware, it's only the battery that I feel needs improvement.But the software was a huge step down. I mean since when did removing features started being called an upgrade? Some very cool features like the car locator widget in the OnePlus shelf, displaying time with seconds in the status bar, have been removed. The shelf has moved to the top right corner, the Google news feed on the left side of home screen cannot be disabled, and the camera doesn't support full screen video recording. Moreover, one of the most significant feature introduced in Android 10, the free form popup window has been removed as well.

"Upgraded from a Samsung phone and got this phone in a very good exchange deal.Based on one-day usage of the phone, I find its look and feel is premium, heavier than my Samsung though with a good processor and battery charging that works like a charm. The biggest cons are it gets heated and the battery gets drained quickly although the fast charging makes up for it. Camera, Unlock feature, Alert slider, Lifestyle modes, etc. are all good enough but the phone is little pricey compared to others in this range for its specifications. There seems to be a software bug in the closing all apps feature which sometimes won't kill the current app. I hope with software updates the heating, battery drain, etc issues get resolved.Will update review on usage.##Update after 2 months usage##The phone is really good.

"Android Auto is such a feature that all of us use almost on a daily basis. I have been using Oneplus 6T for last 4 years, and the feature works so seamlessly in my compatible car. But this new phone (Nord 2T) which is running a latest version of Android 12, doesn't work.  And that's a big turn off for me and I have initiated a return today - hope I get a replacement as the technician appointment is fixed 7 days from now.But if anyone is looking for a smooth device, please don't buy this phone.  In today's times, it is definitely not accepted if a basic feature like Android Auto doesn't work.[EDITED on 15 Oct 2022]: Raised a replacement request - it's not automatic. They called me to say that they will fix an appointment with Oneplus technician after a week (19th) however, the someone from their Bangalore center called up on 13th. Asked me the usual things - like is the software updated, etc. Suggested a reset which I had done the previous night itself. So he asked me to take it to the nearest authorized service center. Took it to Gurgaon service center, demonstrated the problem. They even connected another same model phone from their inventory - didn't work. Conencted a Oneplus 9 and it worked without issues. Took all the debug logs and told me that the they will share with the Bangalore team for fix.In the meantime, one of my friend suggested to change cables. I had already tried with 3 Oneplus cables and one Xiaomi cable - they didn't work. But this time, I tried with a simple cable that I had bought in the local market for some other device. When I connected this cable, bang... it worked! So, in a way, my problem is solved but Oneplus and Google AA team will have to work together to give the customers a seamless way for their products to work.[Edited on 24 Oct ]: Even with the 3rd party cable, it stopped working. :(",Android Auto doesn't work - See edit below for the Fix,2.0 out of 5 stars

"Bought this as a replacement to a Samsung Smartphone. Its very clear that Samsung A53/A52 has OnepPlus Nord in its cross hairs as both try to outdo each other on price and feature. But the real deal is this, on a price to performance basis I don't think Samsung can match OnePlus without cannibalizing its sales of phones which are selling at 50,000 Rs plus range, hence you see things like Samsung capping the Ram and Storage ( i.e deliberately cripple the phone to protect the premium phones). What I found with OnePlus is they go all out on each price point - i.e deliver the maximum which is possible at a particular price point without thinking about cannibalizing its premium range of phone. Also, my last phone which was hardly 3 years phone ( Samsung Galaxy Note 10) died due to water damage - this was supposed to be a IP68 phone, after this incident I don't think paying a premium for Samsung which unlike Apple does not last more than 3 years. If I were to spend 50k plus on a phone I would rather buy an Apple which reliability wise is like the Toyota of the phone world ( my wife's Iphone 6s has lasted 8 years !!).

"I bought this mobile after researching a lot and then finalized it and here is my observation:Great things about this phone:- Super smooth to handle multiple apps- There is absolutely no lag- You can trust battery for entire day and even more if you are a normal user including streaming.- it feels classy in hand, and I use protective cover handle it better.- If you are a normal and above average user, you can blindly go for it as it does not heat at all.- Quick charging is a great feature because it gets fully charged within 15-18 min and if you are going out and if you realize that phone is about it die, you can still make it fully charged by the time you are ready to step out.Things to improve:- Only one area of improvement is Camera Quality, it can slightly improve.If you are going for it, go for 256 GB storage, because you will not have to worry about the storage.

PS- those pictures without edits.STORAGE HUGeeee storage. 12+256gb! It's been 3wk and I have been able to fulfill only the 13% of storage. Though I feel if they could have provided the external storage it could have been complete storage pack.SPEED the touch performance of the phone is pretty good.

"I bought the phone on the basis of my previous experiences with OnePlus but this time I got really very disappointed.I have used OnePlus 5 previously and the phone ran smoothly for 5 years straight.So I thought the technology would have become far better now and I purchased OnePlus Nord 2T.Well it came out as I was terribly wrong and the phone started showing issues in the very beginning especially with the battery.The phone has high heating issues due to which I had to replace the first one within a week. The second one also has some heating issues but has been performing better than the first one.But after using it for 8 months now, I can see a big difference in battery performance. Power drain has been a big issue now. If I use my mobile for 4 hours properly without playing any hardcore games and all, I'll require a charger.Also, the processor in this one is not upto the mark and you can feel some lag while operating it.Camera is something I felt will be of top notch quality in this segment but there also we find a good competition from Samsung, Realme and Redmi budget phones.Overall the phone is not upto the mark against its price and OnePlus itself doesn't pay enough attention to these sidelines as it does with its flagship phones.",Not upto the mark against its price,2.0 out of 5 stars

Camera quality will be more better on this price... As previous sets of one plus are far better than this but its also good I can say it's not best as one plus promise their customers for their satisfactionSound quality is good over all touch perfomance is best. But I don't like it's camera quality. Bettery life is good.I reviewed it after using 6-8 months,80 walt adaptor plus point ... Overall all good not best in terms of nord,3.0 out of 5 stars
I am writing this review after using one month.It fits for the price range as I got this mobile with exchange of my old mobile so if you are getting this in 20k-21k then I will suggest go for it.1. There is no heating issue and heating issue depends on your charging style.2. Camera is good for this money.3. Phone look is great.4. Phone case provided by one plus is very good.5. I didn't face any hang issue.You can go for it if you are getting below 23k. In that range mobil is very good,Value of Money,4.0 out of 5 stars
When I bought this phone it was very nice for 8 months and after that I had many troubles with this there was a violet scratch in phone's display and I changed my display the main problem was 1+has only some service centres. 2 months later my phone's display's light has gone and now I repaired it seriously I am done with this phone I prefer not to buy this,Very bad performance,1.0 out of 5 stars

Using it for about a month. Love the phone for -1. Awesome charging speed - 100% in less than 30 mins. Got so impressed by this charging speed that my spouse asked for a upgrade to same model simply for this one feature.2. Very good battery life - lasts easily for more than a day with moderate to heavy usage.3. Fast performance - works like charm. Finger print reader is super fast and accurate.4. No junkware - upgraded two devices (Vivo v15 pro and Mi A3). Vivo had tons of junk apps that took up real estate and spammed the heck out of user. Oneplus maintains same clean experience as base Android with some nice navigation features.5. Reliable software updates - my work access requires latest security patches - which are always on time.6. Slider button for silent/vibration mode - it is addictive - will find it hard to go back to software based experience.No cons for our usage. Got them on good deals during pre-Diwali sales. Go for it - reliable and peace of mind model.,"Peace of mind, predictable device",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1.The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button2. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.3. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.4. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.5. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever. So the first thing I did was to get a back-cover with rubbery finish.",Best budget phone,5.0 out of 5 stars
"First of all this is my first OnePlus 😊. Let's talk about the pros first.1) Rear Camera is best with Sony Flagship sensor, OIS is working pretty good.2) Dual speaker top front firing and bottom  Speaker is loud and crisp. Good for entertainment.3) Ram is expandable (8+5).4) It has 80W fast charging, feels like very fast. Full charge within 10 to 15 min (mind-blowing).5) Side mounted slider button for activating sound profiles like silent,vibrate. (a must wanted feature)6) Design of the phone is excellent and looks very aesthetic, eye catching from the back.Finally here are cons:1) battery drains easily, it comes with 4500 mAh battery but doesn't feel like that but mildly last a day with normal use.For medium use with normal gaming requires charging about 2 to 3 times a day but doesn't feels bad due to fast charging. But even though battery life cycle reduces fast--So Gamers do go for 5000mAh + series--2) front camera is average as compared to rear one. It does the job, works good in day light and not good in dim lighting conditions.These are the cons i have to point out.My Overall experience is good with this phone cons can be compromised according to this price, specification and afterall this OnePlus badging. It's an experienceGo for it.",Best in Nord series,4.0 out of 5 stars
"This is a review after using the phone for about 10 days. My initial reaction was that the UI sucks - and it does suck compared to the Samsung UI. But OnePlus gives far less bloat ware than Samsung does. (I was upgrading from a Samsung M21). Samsung UI is more slick though.Battery life is very good. It lasts the whole day with heavy hotspot tethering usage. With light usage and no tethering, it easily lasts 2 days. The VOOC charger is great and charges the phone in less than 30 minutes. But even though it’s an 80w charger, it does not charge my MacBook Pro.This phone is pretty close to stock android, and is overall quite good. It has many of the smart features that come with stock android. Like live transcription, automatically copying OTPs from messages, etc.The fingerprint scanner and face unlock are both good.The phone does heat up a bit with heavy hotspot usage - but it’s manageable.The hotspot wifi tethering feature was crucial for me. It works well with this phone. It has a strong 5G radio and a strong wifi radio. No complaints there.The camera sucks. Really. Feels like the camera from 10k rupee phone. But I don’t really care, as this is my secondary phone.Overall, it’s a good phone for the price range.","Pretty good phone, bad camera",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Verdict : A Solid buy for this price segment.Disclaimer:I'm not a OnePlus fanboy. This is my first OnePlus branded smartphone.This review is based on my personal experience with the device purchased here in Amazon)5G is not stable in my region. Hence, 5G related parameters are not included.There are 4 review sections here at various stages of the usage/updates.Review 4 - A week after an incremental update (Feb 2023 security patch | Received on 23 Feb 2023).Review 3 - 30 days after the Oxygen OS 13 (Android 13) Stable Update (Received on 10 Jan 2023).Review 2 - 15 days after the Oxygen OS 13 (Android 13) Open Beta Update (Received on 1 Dec 2022).Review 1 - 30 days after the purchase of the device (Oxygen OS 12.1 | Android 12).-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Review 4:> Ambient Light sensor issue resolved. Both front and rear Ambient light sensors are better responding.> 3rd party icon support has been included.> Spotify support in AOD has been implemented.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Review 3:> Literally no change (neither improvement nor deterioration) from the Beta version.(Wished at least for the Ambient light sensor (front) calibration optimization, but no improvement)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Review 2:(An incremental update to enable Jio 5G received prior to this update).Note: After the beta update, no new issues popped up.i.e., there were;No Heating related issues.No fast battery drain.No change in the Charging time.No annoying bugs.No change in camera performance.Beta update is mostly like a Stable update.OOS 13 (Android 13) update review:Delighters:> No new apps added. Absolutely NOT.> System storage consumption remains the same (13.2 GB).> Animations are more fluidic.> More customization UI features added. (Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder & lot more.)> Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier.> Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor.> Ability to play videos in the background & screen OFF as well (even for YouTube)  (Really a welcoming & longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF)> Stand-by battery life has improved substantially.Disappointers:> Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before.> No improvement in Sound levels. Still initial 40% is too silent.> No Dolby Atomos (which was mentioned for OOS 13). Perhaps, to wait for Stable update.> Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier. Response time is tad increased.> Haptics have become tighter than earlier, but still not stronger.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Review 1:Note:- This review is after a month's usage.- Received 2 updates during the course of time (Recent update was of 0.98 GB).- System consumes 13.2 GB space. 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage.- N77 band is missing for 5G.- The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue.- Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile. No noticeable difference observed. ( In Non-gaming aspect)- Nothing Great or Nothing worse in the unmentioned parameters.Things that are delighting;> Exceptional signal reception (especially 4G+ carrier aggregation). Very fast download speeds.> Insane Fast charging (0 to 100% in 40 mins, 30 to 100 % in 20 mins, excluding trickle charge). No heating of the mobile (just slight warming) during charging.> Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic (Even more than 7.5 hrs, for Videos, YT and general tasks and calls, even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver.> Oxygen OS = Color OS/Realme OS - Bloatware. The skin is really good & nothing to complain like other brands' UI.> Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps. Even some 2nd party apps are ""un-installable"". No major bothering bugs noticed till date.> Yes, the ICONIC ""Alert slider"" is present.Things that are annoying;> Dual ambient light sensor (1 in rear and other in front) is not well calibrated. The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required.> Volume level is useless until 40% level (can be audible only in ""Pin-drop silence ambience). Audible enough only post 40% level. Stereo speakers output are 70% bottom and 30 % earpiece. But full volume doesn't distort & is loud enough.> Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40% and best only @ 90% level)> Hotspot drains battery quickly (even a warning notification pops up). Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly. Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm).> Though the in-hand feel is good, the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit.> Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel.> The inbuild DAC (no 3.5 mm hole and only Type-C port) is not great. The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio output.============================================================================",Really a Good Buy in this price range in 2022,4.0 out of 5 stars

I have used mobiles which cost below 15k and it never hangs but this mobile hangs though I am not heavy user and never play any game. Someone told me it's iPhone of Android and now I feel I am using Lava of Android. Very disappointing. Only good thing is it charges in 10-15 minutes. As you need to charge twice it it would have been more then using this mobile would have been a big punishment. Very disappointing.

"Do read on Nord but let me tell you how and why I bought Nord on the first place! My earlier OnePlus 7t suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason, it turned off and never switched on again and when I visited the authorised service centre, I realised that it seems to be a frequent problem with many user. I was told that this issue can't be fixed and in my opinions it seems to be an issue from makers side because I handled my phone pretty carefully and there was no reason for it to go kaput! So because my phone was not going to get fixed (I lost so much data and other stuff), I bought Nord on Amazon because it seemed to be a cheaper alternative and I didn't have a spare phone so I needed one quickly.Now about this Nord phone, it is just pathetic. I face frequent issues on a daily basis. The WhatsApp calls/videos calls frequently disconnect on its won, apps like Netflix, Jefit, etc. do not work properly and the phone keeps on hanging. I have to frequently restart more than I would like. The battery is also not that great. There is issue with heating too and similarly so many other issues are there which I can go on and on about but if you ask me, based on my experiences of using both these two OnePlus phones, I have decided to never buy any other OnePlus product and I will  not recommend this phone to you!",Bad.

Writing this review after 1 month of use.I will keep it simple:The battery have to be charged twice a day if office apps are used. Not good backup.Camera is good.Mobile is lightweight to carry.The issue is that the headphone this mobile need is C type which is difficult to get in brands.Cellphone is heating up when kept below any cover or pillow.Overall i think There are other Oneplus or mobiles brands that can be a better choice.,Not the best,3.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought OnePlus Nord 2T 5G( Jade Fog 8GB RAM, 128 GB ) on 30th September, 2022 on Amazon by paying.....Little did I understand then that I would regret my decision untill last 24th April I.e. Monday. I suddenly found My barely 6 months  old OnePlus, while put on charge, has been frozen and screen has become unresponsive. Pissed off, I went to the service center Ananya Infotech, Diamond Harbour Road Kolkata on the very next morning as that phone was mainly used for my official communications which, to me, was of utmost importance.Now, after waiting a couple of hours at the Service Center, the front desk lady, to the shock of life and my utter disbelief, told that the phone couldn't be covered under warranty and I would have to pay some 28000 odd rupees ( slightly more than what I paid for the phone size months back). Shocked and disgusted at such unbecoming of a reputed brand as OnePlus, I asked for reason of such denial, to which she said some ' liquid ' was found on the board etc etc. Which, to my sane mind, sounded like some blatant lie and a way rob money from an unsuspecting customer whom your company doesn't seem to value anymore. This may be put on record that I never ever spill any water or any liquid on the phone or never was it placed in a humid ambience. THE phone, as is still apparent, free from any stains, dents or signs of any damage or manhandling, let alone any internal damage inflicted by me!I understood that the Service Center is trying to fleece money from me at the cost of the trust i put in the brand called OnePlus. I asked the lady to install the phone they had opened for so called servicing and return to me. I asked them to put in writing what they told me so that I can place it in legal ambit while seeking redressal in Consumer Court.Awful behaviour like a fly by night company",A pathetic after sale experience,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this phone in August 2022, but just within 7 months I feel regret to buy this phone.. initially I also purchased this phone for friends, but I'll never suggest to go with oneplus. They say it's water resistant but it can't hold even a lowest drizzling. In a very low drizzling my phone could not hold i, it start showing some color dots on screen and after that when you will go to oneplus store, there you'll get worst experiance, they will say that your phone will not be covered in Warranty even if it's purchased before 6 months even it's not damaged physically. In my case they said that they will replace screen for Rs.8800 without any warranty means if its stopped working just after leaving store, they won't be responsible. and if I want warranty I have to pay Rs.21000.Wow what a warranty claim and Oneplus store experiance. If anyone wants to purchase this one phone, then Please once think before purchase, I'll never suggest to anyone to buy Oneplus not due to only quality and also due to as a Oneplus customer experiance..It's so pathetic, I have purchased More than 1000+ products from amazon but I think it's first time when I'm writing a review. I never write a review but the Oneplus Service experiance forced me write this..So Please think before but.. that's it from my side.Thanks.","Worst Experiance,  Please read review before buy, never suggest to buy",1.0 out of 5 stars
Pleaseeeee don't buy this Phone at all..Its totally wastage of Rs. 29K specially if you are Camera lover or thinking about to buy this for any photo or video purpose then it's a humble request for your sake..1. Back camera is Normally good2. Rear 50 MP camera is just only for name also you can't Zoom in when you are using 50 MP option.3. Front camera is like VGA or 2 MP cheap camera.. its 32 MP but i think OnePlus has forgot to add 30 MP and just add a simple 2 MP front camera. I didn't saw this kind of cheap camera Quality.4. OnePlus says Supervooc 80 Watts charger but this is also only for Name it is not any Supervooc power it's like any other fast charger5. Battery backup is too much bad as it charges fast and battery also get drained fast..I wanted to post review earlier but Amazon had blocked review option Today review option started so i am posting a genuine and personal review rest you can take a try if you think i am telling lies,Totally waste of Money 💰,1.0 out of 5 stars

Camera is not great. Realme 6 works better than this.3. UI is very very bad how people's likes oxygen ui I did not understand it's very slow and hangs a lot. Even I disabled all back ground operations including emergency wireless alers, find my phone etc still really bad.4. Phone getting heat easily just for phone calls as well its reaching 39 easily. Why this much heat. I used iqoo there in normal use 29 is temperature.5. Paid 29000 for this scarpI raised issue with Amazon. Amazon is helpless they got their commission so why they will bother.

"just want to share my feedback on OnePlus Nord 2T 5G), I bought this product on 1st Oct, unfortunately, that order is defective. So I was planning to replace the order.I cannot replace it because as per the latest policy, the technician will visit and verify the phone and then the replacement process will start.Now the pain point is that I am staying in the Pune location(Not in a Village area ) you can consider Pune as a metro city, but still I didn't get a call from the technician for visiting.I am an active and regular prime member of amazon, but this time I would say one plus Nord amazon replacement policy is worst because you know mobile is something that keeps us connected with our loved ones regardless of the distance. I would say I am stuck here and can't purchase another cellphone also.If possible please rework this policy and resolve my concern ASAP",Worst replacement policy,1.0 out of 5 stars

I went there after 22days ..They told me parts are not available...and they took me one week more time..So my point of view Very worst mobile which I experienced and very very worst service by One Plus...I want to ask Amazon and Oneplus company provide me one year warranty...And before one month not completing your display is not working and in service centre almost one month completing...I'm not received my mobile in working condition, So who gives me one month extra warranty??If warranty ends in 31-08-2022  and my mobile didn't from 31-08-22 night and another day you went to service centre they didn't give you extand  single day warranty...And Oneplus take one month to providing service ...So guys think about it and take those mobile which is better service provider in your area..",Very worst mobile by Oneplus,1.0 out of 5 stars

"Only 30% charged in 15 minutes. Service center staff in New Delhi charged their phones with the provided charger and their phones also charged slowly. Charging the phones with an alternative charger worked fine. So, as per the tests, they advised that there is an issue with the provided charger.However, OnePlus said they need to confiscate BOTH the phone and the charger even though the issue is with the charger with NO timeline on when the phone will be returned!In other words, OnePlus checked and concluded that a faulty charger was delivered but are finding excuses not to replace it. Oneplus phone support was worse.I found that others have faced similar issues with OnePlus.Buying a OnePlus phone is like buying a lottery ticket: either you receive a good device or OnePlus will refuse to place the faulty product.",Only 30% charged in 15 minutes!

Worst product in the market. Most of the time I'm not able to use internet and hotspot is totally waste in OnePlus Nord 2T.

"The phone is not upto the mark specially the show-off in the camera cover with huge area towards backside.One of the cheapest thing is the 2 flash light in the backside while one is working and another is far just for look.Dimensions of phone is not good because the length of phone is much higher as compared to its width, if this comes .40 inch shorter in the length with same width then it could be better.",It could be better if everything is ok,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I recently bought a Oneplus Nord 2T. Unfortunately, it slid out of my hands one day, and to my astonishment, the screen broke. I applied for replacement after quickly looking out the approved service facility because this breakage is not covered by the guarantee. Even 15 days later, the service centre claims they still don't have the spare. I'm really frustrated that a well-known company like Oneplus can't provide spare parts quickly.",After sales is pathetic,3.0 out of 5 stars
nothing special..normal phone with premium looks.. speaker and sound quality good... Screen resolution okok .. little lag .. handles quite well.. black phone fones with soft back kinda leathery feel . That's nice.. camera okok ..battery very bad..use it for 6-8 months and upgrade.. that's it.. no wow factor . Ok for light gaming but screen lag could be felt... Looks are good..my mom's moto g71 beats this one in all aspects and that's half the price of this.,Just a ok phone,3.0 out of 5 stars
"Phone is good , very responsive and does the basic things well. I have no other complains apart from how quickly the battery drains. On the upside it does charges quickly but the battery drain is too fast even when you lower fps or put on battery saving mode. Have to recharge it daily and if heavy usage ( like 4 to 5 hours ) ,then have to charge twice daily. Do note that charging is very quick.","Good phone,bad battery life.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Most perimeters of One Plus Nord are satisfactory except the performance of the battery. The power drains off very fast after charge of 100%.

I have used this phone for 1 month. Now I am reviewing it. It have a very nice processor. And it can be best for gaming and other hard works like video rendering. It can compete even iPhone 11.Even It supports 5G while iPhone 11 doesn't which cost almost 1.5 to 2 times. I have compared their cameras also both are almost equal. But it have smaller battery capacity than any other phone in this price range. But I have a great display which gives you a wonderful mixture of colours and have refresh rate of 90hz. I have attached some pictures and slow motion video taken by this phone.,I think it's a very good phone in this budget.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Overall a good phone with good performance. It provides near to smooth gaming experience in 90HZ screen.Battery life and camera could have been better considering the price range.

"Writing this review after using phone for 5 days.Previously I was using OnePlus 6T (6GB, 128GB)One plus 2T is a good choise in the mid-range under 30k range. The phone is working smoothly. I am not a gamer and don't play any games but I use multiple apps. I find the phone to be handling very smoothly. I heating issue is solved with the latest update.Some pros and cons are as under ( comparing this phone with my previous phone OnePlus 6T)Pros- Great build quality feels premium, Great speakers, 6+ hrs battery back up, OnePlus user experience, extended 1 yr warranty at only additional Rs 700, Quick charging, smooth experience.Cons- Average Camera, Phone receiver speaker was initially not clear, however I have find it to improve.If you are shifting from any flagship phone to this you will find the device to be very average however this is a best option to upgrade from budget smartphone/first smartphone.Lastly it cannot be compared with nothing phone. It comes in very different price segment. Nothing phone with charger will cost you around 40k, so pointless to compare my view.It's a very safe phone to purchase no compromise however no surprises also. Go for it. My rating 4.2/5.",Smart choice under 30k.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros :- Great display. Smooth (a pleasant 90Hz refresh rate), colors pop out really well, and the HDR definitely adds the extra edge (pun intended).- Premium in-hand feel. The phone feels great in the hand, and has the vibe of a higher end flagship device. well constructed body.- The speakers are clear and well balanced considering phone speakers in general.- The 80Watt VOOC charging is a blessing. The phone charges from zero to 100 in about 35-40 minutes.- Overall, a great purchase in this budget, I believe the One Plus Nord 2T to be the best  smartphone in this price range.Cons :- The battery drains out very quickly.- The phone heats up a bit when using constantly for some time.- The Camera is not really great as I expected it to be, the AI camera mode makes the images blurry and over processed, due to some noise reduction algorithm.- The camera module in the back looks very pooly designed. The are three cameras, but the way it's designed it almost looks like there's 4 cameras. Also, the low res depth sensor feels particularly useless, instead of that, they could just have two camera, one ultra wide and one 35/50mm.",Best phone in this budget,5.0 out of 5 stars

Build quality is nice so feels premium in hand.Camera is also very good. Although I am not much into megapixels and pro usage but it takes great pictures.Front camera is also great.Battery 🔋 backup is 3.5/5 but it charges from 10% to 100% within 30 mins so that kind of evens things out. Somedays I need to charge the device twice a day. I am always using social media like alwayyyyyys even when I am working 🤪🤪Screen quality is also pretty good.What else is left?Speakers? Loud enough and nice.No 3.5 mm jack but nobody cares...Or do you?Call recording notification is there 👎👎 Buy a samsung if that's a major concern for you.,Great phone.,5.0 out of 5 stars

"This is after few days of using the new pixel 7. Let's go straight to the point.Pros:-Great Camera ❤️-Magic erase and unblur😍.- Excellent battery life. During my work week my phone lasts about 48 hours. I uploaded a photo with 26% battery life that's after +48 hours of use. During my weekends when I use my phone more it last about 1.5 day. After the phone drop below 30% I turned on the battery saver go to bed and when I wake up I only lost like 3%. I still had about 26%.- Love the Bright 90hz flat screen.-The call screening is outstanding.- The always on display is beautiful.-There plenty of other features and tricks that Google didn't even announced or made big deal of (Classic google).-Love that they added face unlock.-Also, I tested that battery saver wow that thing is impressive.Cons:-The fingerprint sensor is terrible. I don't know why they cheap out on finger sensor but this s*** ruin the experience every damn time you pick up your phone to use it.-There a little bug on my device and what it does is that I had to tap back button twice sometimes to go back.-The face unlock is 100% works based off the front camera and there are no other sensor used when unlocking the phone.

"The Pixel 7 came highly recommended and at first seemed like a good value. The transition from Samsung to the Pixel was seamless.  Then the issues. First the phone did some random restarting, then overheating, then would not charge wirelessly for more than a couple of minutes without seemingly stopping for overheating issues. if I received a phone call in my vehicle on android auto, I could not answer it. If I was using my phone during a phone call, I could not locate the active phone call. I gave up Samsung features and gained issues without really gaining much in features, I had to send it back because it just wasn't worth it.",To many issues,3.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought this phone for my wife to replace her Samsung A20. I got the Pixel 6 last year and it works great. Once you get used to the on-off button being in a different spot it was no issues. All smart phones are too expensive and the manufactures want you to buy one every 2 years. This phone has all the features of the new Samsung S22 for hundreds of dollars less. This phone is hands down better than an I-phone. Apple will offer the same features as the Pixel 7 in a few years. The camera and editing is awesome on the phone. Google tries to move you into their ""eco system"" just like Apple.  But that is up to you. Moving to a new phone is like moving to a new house. Google makes it easy with the provided cord. All files, apps and contact information took 30 minutes to move over. The process is simple. We have recommended Pixel phones to many people.  Most Apple users are stuck in the Apple ecosystem and are stuck using inferior phones.  To the Samsung / Android users... you will be very happy with this phone.","Love the camera, Switched from Samsung A20",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I went from the Pixel 3A to the Pixel 7. Everything was very familiar so no learning curve required. There were a couple noticeable cons but nothing that should stray anyone from getting the 7.Cons: The 3a finger print reader was on the back of the phone and worked flawlessly. The 7 is an on screen finger print reader that isn't consistent. I ended up disabling it and sticking to a pin. Battery life seems is ok. I'm guessing there's more background processing going on?Aside from the above two items, everything else is a win. The camera is excellent. The added astrophotography mode is a huge perk. I've attached a daytime and nighttime photo. I kind of wish I bought the 7 Pro for the extra camera features.",Solid Upgrade,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought a Pixel 7 for my mom and a Pixel 7 Pro for myself. Less than 50 days after purchase, the main camera of the Pixel 7 inexplicably broke, even though my mother uses it carefully and has had a case and screen protector (Certified by Google itself) since day one.I didn't have to look very far on the internet to realize that this is a common problem. In fact, there is a hashtag on Twitter #Pixel7BrokenCamera. Although it has also happened in the Pro version, but it is much less common than in this one. I contacted Google, and they offered me a replacement at no cost, which would be great if their warranty were INTERNATIONAL. However, to access the warranty, I would have to send the phone to the USA and pay for the shipping, then pay for the shipping of the new phone. I am a person who travels a lot for work, and I cannot be thinking about having to come to the USA periodically if my phone gets damaged. So, I declined the offer.I contacted Amazon and they did offer me a full refund, even though it was outside the purchase warranty. This means that they are aware of the problem and continue to sell the product, even offering discounts despite the number of damaged units.Furthermore, the phone was quite disappointing for the price. Compared to the Pro version, it is a significantly truncated version. Its screen doesn't look high-quality, nor does it feel as premium despite having practically the same hardware as the Pro version. Additionally, one of the selling points of this Pixel 7 series was the amazing Camera and Gallery applications, which had AI tools that used the ""specifically designed for AI"" processor and gave you magical options like deleting objects or focusing on old blurry photos. All were Pixel's exclusive functions until two weeks ago, when Google released the same features for ALL ANDROID PHONES, thus losing any advantage of having a Pixel over other phones with the same capabilities and lower prices.That's why the title of my review is what it is because the Pro version, although not a marvel, is a good alternative to high-end typical brands (like Samsung) but with a lower price, but this version is a waste of money.","IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE PRO VERSION, LOOK FOR ANOTHER OPTION",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Love the phone so far. It's the most Android has been to Apple levels of ""Out of Box It just Works"".Surprised this thing has a fake magsafe for chargers and phone coolers. That was a nice surprise.Still Photos have the classic google look. Video still not the best but for the price absolutely workable.My major draw back though is the fingerprint reader. I'll have the reader work for like 30 minutes and it'll basically forget my finger the next time I use it.I would even save my finger multiple times and it would still eventually not work.Battery life is top notch with the USBC and the wireless making it easier to keep up. Though not one of the strongest phones if you're planning to game or anything. Not meant for it anyways. The translation and camera stuff is superb for the price.I'll wait till the return window to see if I'll keep it though. The fingerprint reader being this bad is a no go for me.

"I was forced to buy a new phone after my Pixel 4a5G suddenly, inexplicably died.  The Pixel 7 was my logical choice (I could absolutely not justify spending nearly twice as much for the 7 Pro model!!!)AMAZON DELIVERED THE NEW PHONE IN LESS THAN 10 HOURS!!!!!  They have an amazing system in place.  What an excellent item to have available for delivery THAT quickly!  When you have no cell phone - you feel completely lost!  VERY much appreciated.The fingerprint scanner on my 5a5G is on the REAR, where it is an instant, no-brainer to simply touch it as you pick up the phone.  It was also 100% accurate and WORKED EVERY TIME.  Economics probably dictated that Google remove the rear scanner and install that functionality into the front screen instead.  Even before I installed the excellent glass screen protector on my Pixel 7 it was quite obvious that it was not as good as that on my 4a5G.  After I installed the protector the reliability became VERY poor.  Sure, there are some protectors that are supposedly 'classified' to somehow be better qualified to work with front scanners...but I doubt it.  I have found though that even with the protector installed, there is a very specific orientation and pressure that will correctly unlock the phone within two tries about 80-90% of the time.  Good enough I guess.Also, I'm also not convinced that the Pixel phone screen needed to be made taller and narrower.  I think I like the screen ratio of the 4a5G better.The Pixel 7 does appear to be significantly faster & more responsive than my 4a5G.NOTE:Nothing at all against the Pixel 7 hardware; Google's software folks do a fantastic job of making it easy to transition to a new Pixel phone - IF YOUR PREVIOUS PHONE IS STILL WORKING - If your old phone is dead, like mine was - not so much!  Though the transition software functionality is definitely in place - it is not well stated or described at all!  It would go a VERY long way if Google would simply put up on the new phone's screen a clear, precise, and in layman's terms, an explanation that 'EVEN IF YOUR PREVIOUS PHONE IS DEAD/UNAVAILABLE DATA/SETTINGS CAN BE RESTORED FROM THE CLOUD' and provide details of the restoration process from Google's cloud backup of your previous phone (assuming that feature was left turned on when the user originally purchased that).Google needs to take a close look at their instructions.  Things that are obvious and self-explanatory to folks that write them and/or just deal with them on a regular basis doesn't mean they will be clear to many other people.I had previously been EXTREMELY impressed a couple years ago when transitioning from my old Huawei phone to the Pixel 4a5g.  The Huawei was still in working order and the transition process was incredibly easy and thorough.  Google seems to have spent an incredible amount of time and effort into that situation/process ... but skimped on the details of other scenarios.  Room for improvement.",Faster than my Pixel 4a5G - HATE the front screen fingerprint scanner,4.0 out of 5 stars
"The Pixel 7 runs Android 13 and has a 5 year software update policy.  This is great.  However, the good things end there.1. T-Mobile wi-fi calling in the US does not work at all.  If left enabled (the default setting), and the phone is connected to wi-fi, incoming calls go straight to voicemail, and SMS messages are not received.  In the rare occasion that the phone does ring for an incoming call, you have one way audio until wi-fi is turned off.  This makes this phone unsuitable as a phone where the signal is weak.  T-mobile as well as google support went though several options, without any resolution yet.  Both our Pixel 7s have the exact same issue.  Web searches tell me that people have had similar issues on Pixel 6 for a year now, without any resolution as well.  The same SIMs work fine when inserted into Oneplus phones on the same wi-fi network.  Even if the oneplus cannot connect to wi-fi calling for any reason, calls are still routed over VOLTE.  So, this is a pixel specific issue.  Google support has taken a bug report for this, and says it is a T-mobile issue.  Though there is also an 18+ month old bug on the one way audio on the T-mobile wi-fi calling on the pixel 6 as well, with lots of comments and no fix.2. You will need to buy all new chargers as many existing chargers do not work with the pixel 7.  I do not expect fast charging speeds with non-USB PD charger.  However, the issue is that chargers will not charge the pixel 7 at all.  For Example: Oneplus dash chargers, both the home and car variety will not charge the pixel 7 at all.  Neither will Apple iPad 10W/2A chargers charge the phone, or the charger bundled with a Roku Ultra.  Qualcomm QC 3.0 compatible chargers are also finiky at times.  But very old Nokia Lumia chargers work well with a microUSB to USB-C adapter.  Newer 20W+ USB-C PD chargers do also work and charge the phone well.  I have even turned off the adaptive charging and adaptive battery in the phone battery settings with the same results.  So, be prepared to buy all new chargers even though you may have several USB-C chargers in the house.3. The pixel7 phone is also quite heavy compared to my old Oneplus which is about the same size.4. The fingerprint sensor is a hit or a miss as well.  On my wife's phone, my fingerprint registered and continued to work from the very first time.  On my phone, I had to delete and register my fingerprint more than 20 times before it worked 90+% of the time.  Both phones are running the same software and have the same screen protector.  And I registered my same finger.  Screen protector mode is on in settings as well.  So, it looks like on some pixel 7s, the fingerprint sensor is less sensitive than others.5. The pixel 7 also lacks a hall sensor.  So, magnetic flip covers will not turn off the display when closed, and turn on the display when opened.  However, with the pixel supporting an always on display as well as lift and touch to turn on the display, this is not a big issue.  Just something to be aware of.6. The earthquake alerts setting seems to be missing on one of our two pixels.  And that phone did not alert us before the last quake as well.  So, the earthquake alerts are not working on that pixel 7.  Working with google support, a factory reset also did not help.  Google support says the phone is faulty and needs to be replaced.  Amazon was willing to refund the phone, but not replace it.  Exploring other options with google for now since I got the phones at a promotional price, and have a few months to return.  Besides, I find it hard to believe that this is a hardware issue.  UPDATE:  Google has fixed this issue with the Nov 2022 play services update.7. On wi-fi 6 networks, occasionally we get very low download speeds - less than 10Mbps.  Other devices on the same wi-fi network have no issues.  The network is 5GHz only.  Several reports of this on the Pixel 6.  So, this issue exists on the pixel 7 as well.  Workaround is to turn off wi-fi and turn it back on.The main issue here is the wi-fi calling.  An unlocked phone - US model ought to work with wi-fi calling on one of the three major carriers out of the box.  I do not get a signal at work, or in many buildings I frequent.  However, they all have wi-fi.  So, without wi-fi calling, this phone cannot be used as a phone.",Lots of limitations,2.0 out of 5 stars
"I got this phone to replace a Samsung Galaxy 5.  I find it's easy to use and for the most part I'm satisfied.BUT!  The main thing I use my phone for is chatting with friends on Facebook, Whatsapp, Telegram and Google chat and probably the feature I use most is voice recognition.  I HATE the word processing program and I can't understand how the programmers can be such idiots.  The one thing I would like is the microphone icon handy for voice dictation, but it often disappears once you start writing and where it was is populated by a bunch of useless type-ahead word suggestions or emoji.  I almost NEVER use these but if I want to voice dictate, I have to go to the keyboard icon and choose the voice dictation.  Also the program inserts a period, question mark, or exclamation any time they would fit within the sentence structure.  This is super irritating.So overall this is a decent phone EXCEPT it sucks at the main thing I want a phone for!","Word processing and voice recognition SUCK!

"I didn't want this phone. My Pixel5 died rather suddenly (likely bc I'd stated to someone aloud how much I liked it and wanted to keep it as long as possible) and I was forced to replace it. I read reviews on new Pixel phones even when I'm not planning to upgrade what I have so I was aware that the 7 still had some of the same annoying bugs as the 6 and was more or less prepared to be annoyed with this phone.So far, it's been fine. It's big. I don't really need the extra screen size but whatever. I miss the dedicated fingerprint reader on the back of my 5 so much. It was perfect. It worked every time and was located right where your index finger rests anyway.I dislike screen based readers (I don't like the one on my Samsung tablet either). And I was prepared to hate this one given the issues people have reported.It's actually fine, if you DON'T use a screen protector. I didn't bother with one on my 5 (Caseology cases have a nice lip on them that keeps the screen off most surfaces and I'm not generally hard on my phones) and wouldn't have on this one except I couldn't get a Caseology case for it fast enough and this phone is SLICK and I don't mean visually (though I suppose it's that, too, but I have it in a case so who cares?) there is literally NO traction at all when holding this thing. It's downright slippery and will migrate down any surface you set it on that's not flat. So, I feared I'd end up scratching the thing before I could get proper protection for it and got some screen protectors for it.Fingerprint reader became almost instantly unusable and that didn't really improve even after a few weeks. I like using biometrics for lots of apps so I ended up removing the screen protector and it's fine again. It still only likes the inside edge of my left thumb but will read that very consistently so I'm fine with it.Still annoyed I had to replace my 5 even if it was 2 years old, but this hasn't been as annoying as I feared. That said, jury is still out on long-term stability and function.I'm firmly on Team Pixel (I had an original Pixel XL first) and likely will be as long as Google doesn't royally mess something up, but it's mostly because I love the pure, unadulterated Android OS experience and getting updates quickly, etc. I feel like any Pixel phone is a good choice for that reason alone.","So far, so good",4.0 out of 5 stars
"So far, I've had OnePlus phones (last was a 7pro), a cheap Samsung and this one.  The Pixel has a better UI to it and I like it almost as much as the One Plus 7pro I had.  I will never get another cheap Samsung again. The UI was clearly a step down from the OnePlus and the Pixel 7.  Yeah, it's a cheaper phone and performance, camera, etc. wasn't as good, but the UI was awful.  Can't help but extrapolate that to the whole Samsung line.  Considering how expensive their flagship phones are, why try one if the UI on the cheap ones suck.The Pixel UI has been easy to use and easier to learn the quirks than the OnePlus and a lot easier than the Samsung.  If I had to pick one word to describe learning the UI, I'd say quick. It went quick. Features on the cheap Samsung were often harder to find and sometimes hard to get set the way I wanted them.The Pixel's camera is better than the OnePlus 7pro (known trade off) and way ahead of the cheap Samsung as would be expected.  The camera is also easy to use so far.  I haven't found much in the way of complex settings to tweak.  Nice zoom, but not spectacular.  Color is great and focus works pretty well.  Pixel count is high enough that it kind of makes up for the Nice but not spectacular zoom.  With it zoomed in to max it's relatively easy to crop down to the precise thing you want without losing so much detail everything starts looking fuzzy.Have not had the drop outs and coverage issues I had with both the OnePlus and Samsung.  Reception is solid and the blue tooth range is great.  Leaving the phone sit, I can get at least 40 feet away with a couple walls in between before my wireless earbuds (BBTek) start to loose the signal.Overall, I rate it as a great value compared to the latest flagship phones.  If you're thinking about the latest flagship but balking at the cost, the Pixel 7 is a great alternative.  Google is an amoral entity and possibly somewhat evil, but compared to something that's ultimately subject to the whims of the Chinese government (Oppo, OnePlus, etc.) and a crappy UI on the Samsung, I'll go with them for now.",Good phone. Would have been a better value if I had been able to wait a month or two.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I've been in the Apple eco system since iPhone 1, but I'm also an avid *NIX user so a few years back I made the leap to Pixel (and specifically Pixel 7 last year).  The Pixel 7 is a phone with lots of potential, but botched by poor execution of the basics.  Here are some pro's and con's:Pro: Rapid software updates from Google. You get in front of the line of other Android phones.Con: Software is BUGGY.  i.e., phone rings and the answer button disappears?! keeps ringing until the call ends with no way to answer it... WTH.Pro: Great camera.  You get a flagship-worthy camera with great night shots..Con: Cinematic video/bokeh is still far behind Apple.Pro: Tensor flow... lots of potential on the new TPU.Con: Apple's Bionic processor still comes up around 2x faster.Pro: Always-on display with better refresh rates.Con: Pain to use...  notifications are wonky when display is always-on and don't show up (Android bug)... and you won't know (for example) when an email or text comes in when the display is always on... I just shut it off the always-on so I can get my notifications correctly/normally.  poor execution/poorly thought out.Con: BATTERY/charging.  This is the BIGGEST botch job on this phone.  Even when you have a charger in hand, chances are it wont charge.  Lots of BS workaround posted online like ""cleaning the plug"", using a different cable, patching the OS, hard starting, factory reset, turning off adaptive charging, etc... it won't charge.  The phone goes into a mode that it acknowledges its connected to a charger but will refuse to charge.  Be it USB-C PD, USB2, USB1, wireless charging, whatever.  If you're on travel, THIS IS THE WRONG PHONE TO BRING WITH YOU!  Trust me on this.  You will thank me later by following this advice.More on the battery: the charger is a proprietary charging circuit from Huawei I think, and it has bugs... lots of them.  So far, I don't think its thermal... and its definitely not mechanical.  About 20% of the time, I wake up in the morning and pick my phone thats been in the charger all night to see it only has 5-10% after charging all night... no reason given.  Next day, its fine.Even more on the battery: so... Android/Pixel does have a battery saver mode... sounds great!  This is a good emergency countermeasure for a broken charge circuit, right?  So you switch on Power Saver... then you plug into the charger (hoping to reduce usage if the charging fails)... but what happens is that Android now says ""Connected, Not Charging"" and since its ""connected"" it shuts off the power saver!!!! Yes... if that sounds ridiculous... thats because it is... So now your phone is not charging *AND* its burning through the battery twice as fast!  If you had 5-6% on your phone, and you plug it in, your guaranteed to drain out the phone even faster!The claim that this phone can work 72 hours is almost laughable, and I would guess eventually legally actionable.  8-10 hours is a more realistic target.I can't stress the battery issue enough... this phone is NOT ready for prime time because of this.  The PIxel 8 should be considered as a hardware patch for this broken component, if they manage to fix it.Last bits of advice:The optical fingerprint sensor doesn't work.  It enrolls fingers most of the time... but then they won't match.  False-negative / FNIR is nearly 100%.  If you add a finger, you can re-enroll the same finger again and the system won't stop you... because it can't match the first enrollment encounter to the second... LOL....  Some people I know have enrolled the same finger 4 times (limit of android) just to make that finger a bit more matchable.  Apparently the Pixel 8 will have the Qualcomm piezoelectric scanner built in, which should be better... but the Pixel 7 fingerprint scanner is not usable.Face recognition is also beta-level software, and not well supported in the OS... so its nice to have... but high error rates, and mostly unsupported by various applications.  I can't estimate how bad FNIR is because its so poorly and inconsistently supported across the platform.My advice to Google:  when the pixel 8 is released, I suggest making it a free swap-upgrade for Pixel 7 owners as an apology ... and get the 7's back and move them in a nice landfill somewhere.  Google has been making phones for 14 years now... these rookie mistakes shouldn't be happening.","Great camera, surrounded by beta hardware... not ready for prime time.",2.0 out of 5 stars

"The reviews for the Google Pixel 7 are excellent and a wide number of highly respective sources including Wirecutter at The NYTs recommended it as the best Android hands down in 2022. Despite all sorts of conflicted feelings about Google and AI given my desire not to be spied on or commodified, I decided the great price Amazon offered when I made the purchase was incentive enough to move from an aging Motorola to this phone.Mind you, the transfer of data could not have been easier.  Online resources are amazing in the number of tutorials you can follow to learn how to use your device.HOWEVER, I find that it is nigh impossible to use the phone without having Google nudge, record, transcribe and watch you even when you opt out of using Google Assistant.A week after setting up the phone, I freaked out when a transcript unrolled before my eyes, documenting everything an automated system was asking me to say or punch on my keypad during a call I had just placed. The mike light was on. After researching the issue online, I tried disabling Direct My Call which was a feat. I disconnected the mike from my Phone app (which unaffiliated online tech websites claim only needs to be connected to the Phone app if I wished to use the Assistant) and ultimately caved when my Phone kept telling me in pop-ups that I have to have the mike connected to the phone. As a result, I could not make a call until nearly 2 1/2 hours when a Google rep walked me through steps to resolve the issue, including resetting permissions for all apps.The plus? You CAN actually interact with Google agents regarding their products and get results.The minus? An utter lack of privacy.  Google recommends keeping Google Assistant on, especially for those who enjoy playing with all the nifty bells and whistles that arrive with each new update. I prefer opting out.Regarding the physical attributes of the phone, please note it is pretty and sleek and heavy. It feels fragile and does not take kindly to plastic screen protectors (mine is VERY noticeable and not precisely scaled to the size of the glass screen). The elegant, compostable sleeve I bought to protect the back of the phone emphasizes what I consider a design flaw: the power button does not project enough. Pressing the volume and power button simultaneously is nearly impossible in order to take a screenshot [vs. turning off the phone, contrary to some online tutorials]. I need to remove the sleeve for that action.Full disclosure: this review has been edited once and its author is new to Pixels. I will edit it again in a few months should familiarity breed contentment.","CAVEAT EMPTOR for those just wishing to text, call & shoot pictures",3.0 out of 5 stars

"The price was right for the Google Pixel 7 phone and I used it for a few weeks before upgrading to the Pixel 7 Pro.  I do like the Pixel 7 Pro better, but the price of the Pixel 7 was decent compared to the 7 Pro.  Either would make me happy but I did find that the touch sensitivity on the 7 Pro seemed better than the Pixel 7.  The 7 Pro touch was as good as the touch sensitivity on my old Pixel 4 XL.  The Pixel 7 didn't seem to be as sensitive as either the 4 XL or the 7 Pro and that was with the 7s touch sensitivity turned up as high as it would go.  The 5G on the 7 was better than my old 4 XL though, so I would have been better off with either the 7 or the 7 Pro compared to my last phone.",Google Pixel 7 was a touch less than the Pixel 7 Pro,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Coming from a 4 and a half year old Samsung S9+, I expected to be blown away by half a decade of technological improvements. Sadly, that isn't the case here. It's actually been kind of a step backwards.Battery life is average. I get better battery life than my last phone at the end of its life, but it isn't as good as when I first got my S9+. The adaptive brightness is very bright, the phone has gestures turned on by default that keep it on almost non-stop (these features can be turned off), and the 5G radio probably drains more juice than a 4G radio. If you're a heavy phone user, you'll need a charger. All in all, I expected better battery life.The features of the phone are top notch. The camera is great, vanilla Android with no bloatware is nice, and not having to fight with other voice assistants (i.e. Bixby) is simply amazing. There's no lag when using the phone. Looking forward to near instant Android updates. The E-sim was easy enough to set up through T-Mobile's website without needing a representative. So that was nice as well.What's not so great? The under screen fingerprint scanner is absolute trash. It works maybe 5% of the time. The phone isn't defective, and I don't use a screen protector. It's the quality of my skin, which is probably too dry. I can literally lick my finger and it'll work. I did not have this problem with any Samsung phone, going all the way back to my S7. With that said, it's difficult to transition back to PIN numbers and copying and pasting from a password manager because of the way the fingerprint scanner works. And I'd rather not be licking my finger, especially in public, in this day and age.I haven't really noticed any huge differences in speed for WiFi 6E or 5G. That was an important selling point for me, so I've been disappointed by real world speeds.Transferring phone info (photos, videos, apps, data in general) was a breeze. The USB-C to USB-C cable made it super simple and it took about 20 minutes. You can choose what to transfer.A phone charger isn't included. Your old charger will work, but if you want the fastest charging you'll probably need a new charger. I picked up a Google 30W charger for another $30.I'm hopeful Google steps up and fixes some issues through software, especially the fingerprint scanner, but I don't expect it. This phone could have been a real iPhone competitor, but Google dropped the ball.","Don't believe the hype, it's just ok",4.0 out of 5 stars
"My 1-month review: If you are like me and watched a lot of tech reviews and read a lot of articles, then you probably already know this is a great phone for the price point. Truth be told, I was very skeptical of this phone because I saw a lot of reviews on the Pixel 6 mentioning that there were a lot of software bugs that made everyday use really inconvenient. However, with the Pixel 7, so far, I haven't had too many issues with it besides initially, not being aware that you need very specific charging cables and blocks for it to actually charge. If you want tech video, you should already know this but the camera quality is AMAZING, though, it does sometimes struggle with low-light shots. The face and fingerprint unlock works great, though, this might change for you if you decide to get a screen protector. I am also a big fan of some of the new features such as live transcription during a phone call, auto-transcription for voicemails, live translation, and auto-ID songs. Just an FYI for people considering this phone, you can purchase this phone via the Google store, however, the return policy is 15 days compared to Amazon's return policy of 30 days.Fair warning: The package ONLY comes with the phone and USB-C charger. You will need to buy the charging block separately. Also, only certain charging cables/charging blocks work with this phone, which is kind of annoying. Don't be like me! When I first got the phone, I thought I had a faulty phone because it won't charge so I had to temporarily use a USB-C laptop charger until the charging block came.",Great phone and cheap price!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Update: 1/10/23 I have had this phone for a month and half now the phone is great especially after the December update still waiting on January update. Battery has gotten a lot better since  Ibought phone but the battery is not going be on par with the Pixel 7 pro or Galaxy S22 ultra those phones have bigger batteries. I come home from work after 8 hours with 40 to 55 percent with moderate use and when I go to bed im at 30 to 35 percent. If I use fanduel or apps that update live data battery drains faster that was also the case on my Galaxy S20. The fingerprint and face recognition have always worked even before December update even better than my S20. Only con if it is a con the phone is slow charging the phone but one could argue that by not fast charging the life of the battery will greatly increased due to less heat. I have not experience any heat issues unless I'm using high CPU apps and the phone does not get hot but warm nothing extreme. I will update in about 2 to 3 months for now my 5 star stands.Initial review I only had this phone for a few days but I really like it so far. I used galaxy S series since the S3 but rising price, the removal of MST, and micro SD card slot I couldn't justify the price I was paying Galaxy S phones. Boost mobile does not sell pixel so I wondered if I could use an unlock phone and with mixed info online I decided to take the chance. To activate phone you have to call so boost can register the phone on their network it won't work by online swap. The phone is still learning how to I use the phone for battery optimization,  but I am getting 12 hours with moderate use. I live in metro area and I am getting blazing fast speeds but when indoors speeds drops off but not enough where you can't use the phone unless you are in a dense structure with thick walls. Only issue I had and not due to the phone itself is moving my Samsung calendar to Google calendar but overall this is a great phone especially at the price point. I will update after I have had the phone for awhile.",Works on boost mobile great phone former galaxy S user,5.0 out of 5 stars

"After working hard in the Fall season, I finally treated myself to getting the Pixel 7. The phone was great, but it keep in mind when you first start using the phone, it's gonna feel warmer than normal.  Within a day or two, the throttling will stop because the phone will adjust to the needs that you're giving it. Android 13 is buttery smooth, but you're gonna see some glitches here and there. The display is also good, it can get plenty bright. One thing I don't like is the color shift if you look at the phone from a certain angle. The battery life is good but could be better, this phone can last you all day if you're using it lightly or moderately use. If you're a heavy user, yeah this phone's battery life ain't for you. The cameras are class-leading. Great details all around, A+ Google HDR software processing... So, on Jan 8th, I was on YT, watching videos. My phone started to trip, so it reboot itself to correct itself. A few minutes later, I watched a bit of TV and came back to my phone. My phone was dead. Mind you, I still have a good amount of battery left. I tried to turn it on, but it won't come on. I tried to hard factory reset it, but it won't turn on. Pressed the power and volume buttons to get it into Recovery mode, but it won't turn on. I even charged it, but it wasn't charging. The phone just gave out. So, the Pixel 7 is being returned while I'm posting this review, on waiting refund as well. Overall, it's not a bad phone. But be careful with the defective units out there.

"I purchased this phone and I think this phone has a lot of great potential going for it. My daily phone I use a lot is a pixel 4A and it's useful it gets the job done the form factor is perfect for my hands. So after I got the pixel 7 for two days, I immediately liked it a lot the camera is awesome everything is smooth it runs fast but the more I held it it's just to big.. I'm one with a pixel 4A where I can reach my thumb to pull down the notification easily. The pixel 7 you have to use two hands to pull down the notifications ?!!, I'm sure there is a option in the settings with one thumb functions but I didn't find it.There is a lot of Pluses for the pixel 7 but I just think when you have your right thumb trying to reach the other side of the phone its really annoying. Bigger is not always better. I just like smaller phones easy to hold easier to put into your pocket... And lastly this phones back is so slippery placing it anywhere couch, table this dang thing slides so much you'll think it has the cheapest back cover brakes known to man. And lastly...The sides of this phone is so very slippery too..  Yo it's like a small child about to eat an ice cream cone as he grabs it lightly then suddenly the top of the vanilla ice cream pops out of his hands. Idk if it's just to coating on it just felt heavy one handed use.",Google pixel 7,4.0 out of 5 stars
"2024 Update: Still using this phone, and it will be my last phone from Google. Never mind that the software experience has gone from bad to worse, it was not even eligible as a trade in for the Pixel 8 that directly replaced it. Then an update to the Pixel Camera app in November 2023 effectively broke its primary camera app for many users on all Pixel phones in hilarious ways (crashes on startup, can't save photos, restarts phone, mistimed flash, etc.) despite months of 1-star reviews... Look for yourself on the Play Store! (An eventual update in January 2024 seemed to fix nothing.)Google Assistant works worse than ever. Notifications are late and only sometimes play a sound. Those cool calling features like Hold For Me rarely show up anymore in practice. Plus, the battery can no longer make it to the end of the day without having to charge with only medium use. If Google can't be bothered with its own phones and the apps it makes for them, you probably shouldn't either.Original Launch Review: Finally upgraded from a Pixel 3. Under-screen fingerprint reader is working much better than I expected, but still a design decision I disagree with strongly. Fingerprint (I should say thumbprint) unlocks are near instantaneous when they happen, but sometimes it does take a couple of tries. Multi-auth sessions (phone unlock + secure app unlock) do not usually take any longer than a dedicated fingerprint reader -- at least so far.The actual device hardware is okay; the phone feels heavy and solid. The hard edge on the camera bump makes no sense to me, needlessly adding more areas for dust and lint to collect that feels unnatural and awkward in the hand. The official case does not solve this problem. Sound is well balanced for stereo but about what you expect without real front-facing speakers; there appears to be one speaker on the bottom-right edge of the device and another underscreen up top. Audio is too tinny to my taste for music, but I am impressed with that balance of sound from L to R between mismatched speaker types.Software-wise, the Pixel-to-Pixel transfer process was terrible, relative to recent experience with Samsung-to-Samsung. Some apps came through with their settings intact while others needed to be set up again from scratch or synced manually. A few old legacy apps I relied on were suddenly no longer supported despite using the same version of Android. System settings were a mess seconded only by another maze of broken menus for the Google Assistant. Scroll momentum felt actively bad on the device, although it was improved quite a bit by installing a ready software update. I expect this to continue to improve in time, although it again begs the question: Why didn't someone try this before making a bunch of them?For $600 on the 128GB model this thing is a steal though, and I feel confident recommending it easily. I think Samsung's doing a better job of maintaining consistency within their ecosystem, and Motorola is doing a better job at Android than Google, but for the hardware and camera you get here on a flagship device there is very little to complain about so long as you are comfortable waiting for Google to improve device performance and features via software updates.Would I rather see another Google-made device with a flush candy bar design, stereo front-facing speakers, and a dedicated fingerprint reader like my old Pixel 3? Definitely, take my money. But until that one shows up, this one will do just fine.",No longer worth it,2.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had a few pixels in the past, so when my Pixel 6 Pro died (my fault as I shattered the screen and it wouldn't work with 2 after market replacements), I bought this one.  Phone signal is decent, but connection to WiFi is terrible. My laptop will be streaming movies with no lags, while my phone will struggle to load an app (this one included).  I also could be connected to WiFi and my phone will randomly disconnect from it (my laptop remains connected), so I have to go in and manually reconnect. I live out of the US and had this sent to my friend to bring me when they were coming back, so I can't return it.

"I'm very happy with my Google Pixel 7 256gb purchase.  I have had it now for about 3 months and I couldn't be more content with my purchase.  I was dead set on getting the Iphone 14 but decided last minute to get the Pixel 7 because it was more economical and still had the features I was looking for.  Not to mention the fact that in getting the Pixel, I was able to then use the other money I had set aside to get a GoPro Hero 11 creator addition, more accessories, and cases for both my phone and GoPro for the price I would have paid for the iphone and an otterbox alone.The interface is easy to use, and I like the android platform more than I thought I would.  My previous phone was an Iphone and I was worried that I would loose the easy to use platform that I had become accustomed to.The cons - The fingerprint reader at times doesn't recognize my fingerprint.  I mostly attribute this to the fact that I work in a restaurant and after touching hot things for an extended period of time, my belief is that my fingerprint is just damaged enough to where the device has a harder time reading it, and the technology itself for reading fingerprints is a little outdated.  The other thing I have noticed is that when I go from being on wifi to out and about, some times my device has a hard time connecting to my 5g smoothly which will make my IG or Pandora not want to work.  When I have this issue, a quick restart seems to do the trick.With the cons in mind, I still think that the google phone is an excellent option and I am very glad I purchased it.  I likely will stick with google phones in the future unless something else catches my eye enough to make me want to switch.",Great Purchase!,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The phone itself worked and had some cool features, but BEWARE! I did a lot of research and weighed the pros and cons of switching from Samsung to a Google phone. The Google 6a still had more issues than I was willing to put up with so I waited for the Pixel 7 to see if those issues would be resolved. To my excitement, they were. I got this phone on Friday afternoon and by Saturday afternoon while out running errands, the phone was constantly dropping cell service. I was in a 5G area, and I've lived here for 4 years, so I know I should have had service. I got home, followed some online instructions to reset the network and hoped it would work. The next day, on Sunday, I went out for the day and again had no service off and on. I have Cricket service, so I went to the Cricket store and spent an hour troubleshooting and replacing the SIM card. I walked out hopeful and halfway home, I dropped service. I contacted Google support on Monday morning and after 2 hours, they told me that dropping service and having WiFi connection issues has been a problem since the phone launched in October of 2022. They assured me that they are trying very hard to have an update that will ""hopefully"" resolve the issue within the month, but they can't guarantee it. They also told me that even if the update works, it's only going out in batches, and it could still take another month before this phone gets the update. I work from my phone quite a bit and travel fairly frequently, so not having reliable service is a make or break for me. My phone is essentially a mobile computer and while there are some cool features, it's not worth months of hassle waiting for an update. I would switch to the Pixel 7Pro, but Google informed me that it's been an issue with that phone, as well. Hopefully in the future, Google will do a better job at making sure the basic features work instead of focusing on whether or not the home screen can rotate. Hope this helps in someone else's decision on whether or not to purchase this phone, as I wish I had known this was an issue to begin with.","The phone itself was not defective, but the service was.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I've had this phone for a little over a month now so I thought I would give my thoughts on it.I upgraded this phone from a pixel 5 and so far I like it just fine. The one issue I have with it the most is the fingerprint reader. I have learned to register my finger from multiple angles multiple times so that it works better. If you register your finger once you will have a lot of problems. I actually have three profiles for one finger. Also, I have noticed that after I wash my hands, the fingerprint reader doesn't pick up my fingerprint until my finger dries out all the way, which is annoying.The camera works well and I like taking photos with it. The phone is snappy and works well with the new version of Android. The screen is nice but has the same refresh rate as my old phone so nothing new there. The haptic feedback in this phone is much better than my Pixel 5. So far the phone is very stable and I am on the beta program so I get updates earlier.

"I bought this phone for the reviewed photo quality and softwares behind the photos taken. As for that aspect, the phone is wonderful. All the photos are taken wonderfully and the software is easy to understand and use. However, some problems I do have with the phone are the touch screen sensors for unlocking the phone and the sound output when watching videos. The touch screen is really on and off, sometimes the phone unlocks sometimes the phone never unlocks, I've never used a touchscreen unlocking device but the incovience is mildly infuriating. Finally, the sound quality was weird when initially using since the phone is designed with a audio output on the top of the phone and one of the two outputs at the bottom, the sounds that comes out when watching a video with the phone horizontally felt really bad.

The screen is tall and narrow compared to my iPhone, which makes it more annoying for watching YouTube videos.Despite these issues, I recommend this phone if you're not going to be using it a lot. If I were an avid phone user (I'm not) I would pick something with a larger screen like the Pixel 8 Pro.As a side note, I would recommend this phone over the Samsung A54 because I have used Google's Magic Eraser a lot to clean up my photos, and the Pixel looks nicer in my opinion.",Quality Construction and Software,5.0 out of 5 stars
"So I can afford a new device more frequently, I avoid those expensive flagship phones.  I usually settle for phones costing about $350 or less.  Sometimes I go too cheap, and, as the saying goes, you get what you paid for.  Considering what goes into a phone these days--and I'm strictly an Android user--I figured a smart, economic buy would be the latest Pixel.  Considering Google is designing the software anyway, they're an entire enterprise based on successful software and AI.  These will be the innovators of cellphone software.Well, this did not disappoint.  It's 5G, with WiFi calling, and the camera is excellent.  If there's one complaint, it's that the fingerprint reader seems to fail a lot--and I do mean a LOT--and I think that's because the screen protector on it distorts the imprint.  I checked other settings on it that allot for the screen cover, but it didn't seem to work on the level I was hoping for.  I have mixed feelings about that.  I would prefer that it had a fingerprint pad, like others phones I've had.  Whatever the issue is, it's not at all a dealbreaker.  If it bothers me too much, I'll just remove the screen protector.However, depending on how you feel about the fingerprint issue, I'd recommend this phone if you're looking for a phone that has the features of a higher-end device, but you don't feel like paying a thousand bucks for it.  I think I'll keep this phone for a couple of years, instead of my usual pattern, to buy a new one every few months.",I'll Keep this One a While,5.0 out of 5 stars

One of my favorite features is the adaptive charging for overnight. It seems what time your alarm is set for and slowly charges to 100% at your alarm time. This will in theory help with overall life of the battery. The only 2 knocks on it (and the reason for the 4 stars), is I cannot always get a full day of use on a full charge.

"I just got the phone yesterday and I'll return it.My last phone was the Samsung A51 brought in April 2020. This phone had a broken camera and battery after about 6 months for no reason - I treat my phone carefully.Before we get into the negative stuff I do have to praise two aspects.- The camera of the phone works really well. I have taken a few shots at night yesterday in my room and I was quite surprised. Compared to my broken Samsung gallery a perfect upgrade.- I like how the phone lies in my hand. It is really easy to type for me.However, I started setting up my new phone today and got only trouble. First, I got the 256GB version because my gallery is about 60GB big, yet my backup in google photos tries to make a backup and is now full so nothing works. (I don't need a backup - I just need a separate gallery.Second, overnight - my phone was done with all updates yet it lost over 20% battery and I also noticed that the battery percentage was reducing quite fast even after the setup. Regarding the fact that my old phone's battery was broken so fast, I still felt the googles battery was going away even faster.Third, for some reason, I cannot set the system's color to white. I always have the nightlight feature activated on all my devices but even without the nightlight activated on my google pixel, it still looks more orange or green (whichever color you choose) than other devices.Fourth, the fingerprint sensor rarely recognizes my fingers. Before the A51 I used the A5 and there the fingerprint sensor wasn't the best but that was over 6 years ago and I have the same problem again.Fifth, restoring my WhatsApp backup didn't work. I made a backup of my chats the day before I got the new phone, yet it said there was none available. So I don't know if this is a phone problem or WhatsApp, yet it drives me crazy.Sixth, the phone's speed works fine however I don't see a real improvement in the 8GB compared to my almost 3-year-old Samsung. Yes of course it is slower after these years but the pixel didn't impress me.Last but not least, the features to personalize your phone seem very limited. I can't change the lock screen clock, I can't get rid of the news page left to the first home screen when opening my phone it always shows the day and date on top - which I absolutely don't need. I would rather have more space on the first page.Overall, I am pretty sad. The google pixel seemed very promising and there wasn't really another phone competing again it so now I am on the lookout for another option to replace my old phone.",disappointed,2.0 out of 5 stars
"I've been using Pixel 7 since November and have to say this is a quality device.  I use this for nearly everything and would describe myself as a power user.  I game on this (CoD Mobile/Apex/Supercell games/Among Us/Ninja Turtles/etc..) and they have all worked great for me so far, no issues.  I hadn't been much of a mobile gamer for a while but playing on this has re-ignited that and made it enjoyable again.  The pictures are amazing and the smart features/overall aesthetic of android 13 are as good as they've ever been.I use this thing for playing music and movies they all work great, casting to other devices is seamless (especially for youtube and apps that support it) and bluetooth has never had a single issue.  It works great with Android auto (where you get to see just how amazing google assistant can be), google pay and wallet.  I also have my full work profile setup and automated to turn on during the workday as well as a bedtime routine with customized DnD. The now playing feature showing what's playing around you even while locked is amazing.  I don't see myself ever going back to another phone.The fingerprint scanner is not as good as previous versions and the battery life leave some to be desired. Other than that I have zero complaints about this thing.",Peak Android Experience,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Overall this is a great phone and gets the job done. I have ran into a few quirks that are a bit disappointing though. The first is sometimes calls will just not come through to my phone from regular contacts, i believe this is a bug with the spam filtering feature google has for their phone calls but im not sure. It can be really annoying to not even know when you have missed calls until that caller mentions trying to contact you. Secondly, if you do any mobile gaming this phone has a weird aspect ratio that cuts the screen a bit too much for most games. It's not the worst but can be annoying how much extra screen space could be used. Lastly, i was missing the quick switch adapter when i received this phone and while it isn't a huge deal, it made transferring content from my S9+ so much more of a hassle than it needed to be.",Satisfying enough,4.0 out of 5 stars

"After having used the Pixel 7 for a few weeks now, it hasn't met my expectations coming from a Pixel 3a. The Pixel 7 is my third Pixel device and seems to lack a lot from previous jumps and the competition. Moving from the OG Pixel to the Pixel 3a was amazing; the finger printer reader worked great, the battery life was awesome, and the device just worked for about 4 years! The 7 seems quite weak in comparison with this latest upgrade. The fingerprint reader only works about 50% of the time even with the sensitively changed to compensate for a screen protector, the battery life isn't great, and the camera, along with its features, leaves a lot to be desired when compared to something like an iPhone 14. I'll keep the 7 for a while, but if the Pixel line doesn't improve then I may have to look to an iPhone since the cost savings between the two devices doesn't seem worth it. It feels like I should have just spent a few more hundred bucks and moved to the better-equipped iPhone.",Not an impressive jump from a Pixel 3a,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I had a pixel 5 I bought new in 2020 and it was stolen in early July of this year 2023. Google had even replaced the battery for free after the phone was out of warranty because it swelled and was failing.  Also the pixel 5's were the last to have unlimited photo storage.  I knew I wanted another pixel to replace my stolen one.  I first bought a pixel 7a because it had just came out in June.  The phone charged wirelessly very slow and didn't seem to have good battery life even compared to my 5.  I decided to return it well within the return window from best buy and was charged a 50 dollar restock fee.  I'll never buy from them again.  So I bought the pixel 7 from Amazon and I have zero regrets.  It charges quickly wireless and I love the phone.  It has better battery life than my 5, takes great pictures and the screen is a bit larger.  I would recommend this phone.",Wonderful phone with great battery life and good wireless fast charging,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I really, really, really tried to like the Pixel 7. Both my wife and I got Pixel 7s because of Google's update promise, the cameras, the Google apps, etc.  Got off to a rocky start when our phones were stuck on the Nov 2022 update and we were into Feb.The thing that bugged me most about the phone, though, was the call audio.  It's the worst call audio of any cell phone that I have owned. The problem was most noticeable when talking to someone on another Pixel 7 (like my wife has). The audio was distorted, with a sibilant hiss in the high frequencies. The microphone is extremely sensitive--my wife re-gripping the phone, swapping hands, changing her position while sitting down, etc would distort the audio. I was constantly having to ask her to repeat herself.The problem wasn't limited to the Pixel 7s, but also caused issues when talking to people on other cell phones and land-lines.  Multiple people told me (unsolicited) that call audio from me was poor on their end.Google had put out a 'Clear Calling' update in Dec (which our phones hadn't gotten since we were stuck on the Nov updates).  We were hoping that would clear up the audio issues.  We finally got the update in Feb, but 'Clear Calling' didn't fix the issues. I'll probably return the Pixel and try another manufacturer.UPDATE:  I returned the Pixel 7, and got a Samsung S22+, and have had no audio issues at all talking to my wife on her Pixel 7, which she kept. Driving to work, the Pixel would drop from 5G to 4G LTE in one area and the S22+ stays in 5G (at 3-bars out of 5).","Poor phone call audio, connectivity",3.0 out of 5 stars
"It's a boring old Android phone directly from Google. It will do a great job... for just a few years, which is exactly why I am here. See, my old Pixel phone was just fine but no longer received software updates. All the new Android 13 stuff is was out of reach unless you pay to play. Software wise Android has gotten quite good and worth the upgrade for the OS. I largely use iOS devices because I can keep them pretty much until their end of life, well beyond any Android.As for the Pixel 7, it's snappy, a little large for my liking. Well build, but so much glass I will likely destroy. The front metal lip where it meets the glass is quite uncomfortable - not very ergonomic, digs into the hand, a little scratchy even. The massive camera bump isn't my favorite in-pocket experience either. Kinda hate the industrial design to be honest. But again, for me, it's all about Android OS 13.",It's fine,4.0 out of 5 stars
The pixel 7 has a great camera and is overall a decent phone. However I was disappointed with the battery life and with the processing time portrait images take; often the camera will freeze and you will miss a shot because it's busy processing previous pictures you took.

"I spent two days trying to get this phone working with Tracfone Wireless. With new SIM card installed I could not get service. Tracfone sent another SIM, still no service. I finally went to Goggle tech support and found there is an issue with (Tracfone) Verizon and Pixel 7. This issue is being fixed but not until mid December.If you use Tracfone and or Verizon you will not get service signal.Update 12/6/22 - Today Pixel did a large update which fixed the issue of connecting to Verizon. Got good signal with Tracfone Verizon. I've updated the Star rating but not as good as it should be due to the initial inability to connect. Will follow up with reviews as I use this phone.Update 12/13/22 - No connection issues with usual good cell signal with Tracfone.This is turning out to be a great phone.

"I was wondering if people were just using the touchscreen fingerprint scanner wrong or with dirty hands, but the concerns are legitimate. Something about the reader behind the touchscreen makes it extremely ineffective.I ""upgraded"" from a Pixel 3A, and only because the USB-C port was failing and the battery was getting too worn out to bother repairing.A far bigger issue than the fingerprint reader is the Pixel 7 isn't compatible with all carriers out of the box. When setting it up, you may need to skip setting it up with a SIM and get everything migrated and updated using wi-fi. Then, log into Google and opt in for the Android 13 betaFor Straighttalk and Verizon users this is required, for some reason it just won't recognize any service until Android is on the beta version.Speaking of Android, the home button is gone, replaced with swipe up. This same motion also brings up running apps, so sometimes when you want to kill apps it brings you to the home screen instead or vise versa.In apps that require side swiping, it seems too sensitive, often trying to change to other running apps.Hopefully there's a way to edit these gestures and the home button, but out of the box I hate them.Lastly, paid apps that are fine on the Pixel 3 you can't even install on the Pixel 7, even though they should be fine. Eg games like Atlantic Fleet. So you'll need to learn to sideload apps and modify your Android OS to accept older apps, which is super annoying.","Fingerprint reader concerns are legitimate, and you may have carrier issues",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased this phone in December, 2022 after my previous phone, a Pixel 5a, suffered a hardware failure. I was satisfied with the 5a and felt comfortable staying within the Pixel family -- however I was unprepared for the dramatic step backwards in photo quality.Despite seemingly endless reviews lauding this phone's camera, it's shockingly bad -- compared to even the 5a -- in many very common scenarios.Firstly, it uses AI to process photos. This cannot fully be turned off, and the AI has a tendency to over-process photos, leaving them washed out and lifeless (with the exception of architectural or landscape photos, which are the only types it can take well). This is all the more frustrating because all appears fine when you view the screen and snap the photo -- leaving you to watch in frustration as the phone takes the photo and then immediately manipulates that phone into a hysterical overkill, as if HDR was applied at a setting of 150%. Secondly, this phone cannot take even average selfies. The selfie cam applies a fish-eye effect that also cannot be turned off.The combination of these flaws is remarkable. Try to take a selfie, and firstly your skin will be washed out and pale, with every line and blemish comically amplified, and secondly the distortion introduced by the selfie cam will make your shoulders appear unnaturally far away. It's very unnatural looking -- and NOTHING like the reliable photos even an older Pixel can take.On top of this, the phone's focus actively fights the user, as if it knows better than you. If you tap an item on the screen (i.e., the actual subject of your intended photo) it almost immediately gets distracted and shifts the focus to something else, forcing you to tap the screen again in an attempt to refocus, only to have the phone's ADHD kick in again, again and again. The phone may have more processing capability than predecessors, but it's software leaves much to be desired as it seems to be written assuming the average customer cannot be trusted to choose the focal point in an image.I've since traded this phone for a OnePlus 11 5G and am shocked at how much better its camera is in nearly every use case. (Again, despite reviews that almost always declare the Pixel the better photo taker. I don't understand this, short of people just having a sort of latent bias for Google.)Overall, Google has lost me as a customer.",An average phone with shockingly disappointing photo capabilities,2.0 out of 5 stars
"The Google Pixel 7 is a massive disappointment.  Google has screwed everything up about this phone compared to other Android phones.  First some background... I was using a dual sim OnePlus 8 on the T-Mobile network.  The OnePlus phones are ""extremely better"" than Google phones in every conceivable way.  My wife decided to save a few bucks and switch to Spectrum, which doesn't support OnePlus so I was forced to get a new phone.  My choices were Samsung or Google.  I didn't want to spend the extra money on Samsung so I went with Google.  I ended up having to buy 2 phones since the Google phone doesn't support dual sim on the Spectrum network.  I ended up purchasing a Pixel 7 for my work line and a Pixel 6 for my personal line.  This review is for the Pixel 7.  In 2023 this was the Googles flagship phone which is really hard to believe.  I feel like I have gone back in time over 10 years.  The OnePlus 8 dominates this phone in the following categories...  Battery life, Charging Speed, Processing Speed & Memory Handling.  File Management and Photo handling is horrible on this phone.  I can't take a picture and then select it as a file to attach to an email message or text message.  It forces me to share it through a method that requires a google sign-in.  I still haven't figured it out yet.  I can't image a worse implementation.  They have made something so easy so difficult.  I am sitting in church and my phone starts ringing even though it is set to silence.  Turns out that getting the phone into silence is more complicated than an old guy like me can figure out.  OnePlus had a convenient switch on the device - it was so easy!  Compared to OnePlus's Oxygen OS - the setup of the interface is so disappointing.Something as simple as flipping the arrangement of the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Everything about this phone sucks compared OnePlus 8.The Pixel 6 I bought is just as bad.  I strongly recommend that you pass on Google phones.

"This was my 3rd Pixel phone. I had the pixel 2 and the 4a 5g. I loved them both. I bought the 7 and had such high hopes.It's a beautiful phone. The video is gorgeous and the sound is good. I loved the camera.From day one the phone ran hot and the battery life was awful.For example: I would charge my 4a 5g to 100% at night and unplug it when I went to sleep. In the morning my phone was still at 99-97%.I did the same with the 7 but by morning it was at 80%. That's a 20% loss overnight with no use.One 10 minute phone call took it down another 10%. My other pixels barely registered a loss on phone calls. I always turn the screen off when I'm talking.I am so disappointed in the battery life!If I read the news on my phone with screen at 50%, the phone got so warm I could feel it through the case .Thank goodness for Amazon and easy returns!* Update- my husband bought a 7 the same time as me. He said the most recent update helped his battery life. It still wasn't as good as his pixel 3 but it's better. I went ahead and bought another one. I'd agree that the most recent update helps, it's still not as good as the Pixel 4a 5g or the Pixel 3 but it's better than before. Also my new one does not get hot. I've updated the 1 star to 3.

The screen is nice but I think it could be a bit brighter and at least in my opinion the colors look a little dull. When it comes to the fingerprint sensor it can be a bit inconsistent but it hasn't been that bad for me. Also, the battery life is decent but if you want a phone with really great battery life there are probably better options out there. As for the positives using the phone feels very fluid and the camera is great.

It's probably the number of applications running in the background, but I don't know. Also, the fingerprint scanner works probably 75% of the time, so I just use the facial recognition instead. I have only had this phone up and going for a few days, and it's nice that the software is pretty much identical to my 5. I guess I'm giving it 3 stars because I had my hopes up for better battery life. I haven't tried out the camera yet, but it's supposed to be pretty nice.

As far as battery life goes, it is about the same as any phone I've had and it just depends on your brightness, background apps, and what apps you use (disappointed how fast the battery drains when playing games). I like the wireless charging feature but most phone cases block it from working (can't blame Google for that). The phone does get pretty warm when playing games or while charging, but has never overheated.I was really bummed that you only get a charging cord with this phone and no block.

Its noticeably bigger and heavier than my current Galaxy S10e but I felt I could live with that.

I've felt the in call volume could be a bit better but overall I was excited about this phone and happy to use it, especially for the sale price. The biggest issue I'm having is with slow data speeds. When using wifi, everything loads quickly and smoothly but I was recently without wifi for the first time since getting this phone and was having a really hard time loading any websites or apps, despite the phone showing 5G. Sometimes pages would partially load but other times they wouldn't load unless I refreshed multiple times.

It only comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable, no wall plug.  When using the majority of my USB cables and plugs it looks like it is charging, but when checking settings it says ""connected, not charging"".  This hits after assuming the phone has been charging all night.

For a phone with no headphone jack this is a show stopping issue!

"I have been using this for few months now. I don't even have to write a review for camera, its so good, period. Battery life is not the best out their but easily gets me through the day as I don't have very heavy usage. Screen is beautiful. I do face some problems in software but I am hoping they would get fixed in software updates, hence I took one star off in my review.

"My first pixel phone. Moving away from oneplus because of dreadful color os. Pixel has clean android experience which does not get in the way. Things I don't like are very few. Most of my gripes is with the fingerprint sensor which fails often and is a constant source of annoyance. I wonder how a behemoth like Google has failed to figure this out when even cheaper Android phones do it better.Love pixel camera. The processing is amazing, especially on main camera. Though when using night sight for consecutive photos, the camera app kept crashing. This problem solves on rebooting the device.I have read reviews of a bug riddled pixel 7. Though in my experience I didn't find much bugs other than the two discussed above. Solid performance at budget price",Best value for money phone with poor fingerprint sensor,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Fingerprint reader .. DON'T GET ME STARTED!!  This has been a complaint with the Pixel phones for how long now?  Is it a cheap fingerprint scanner or mediocre software?  Which ever it is Google can't seem to figure out how to make a fingerprint reader that can actually read a fingerprint 95% OF THE TIME.Camera is OK .. not great or anything like I thought it would be .. just OK.  (I think my Galaxy S10 did better with pics)Overall I like the Google Android OS much better than Samsung, lots of little things are just nicer.  Which actually surprised me given Googles tendency to ""lose interest"" in projects once they are in motion.Would I buy another Pixel?  Good question and to be honest the jury is still out on that.  At this moment I'm about ready to disable the fingerprint reader .. it SUCKS that badly.Would I recommend the Pixel to others?  If a functional fingerprint reader isn't important then I guess I could say yes.  Ya, the fingerprint read is THAT BAD.UPDATE:  4 months have passed, I had hoped by now google would have fixed the fingerprint reader issue .. but alas NO!  That is a serious deal killer for me to ever recommend the Pixel.  I dropped my review to 2 stars because of fingerprint reader being next to USELESS!!  If only ... but right now that is wishful thinking.Another UPDATE:  Pixel had another update just last week, guess what still doesn't work for sh!t ???  You got it the fingerprint reader.  II like the phone for the most part, but this fingerprint reader not working is a deal killer ... STILL!  I do not recommend a PIXEL phone, and I for sure won't be buying another one.","FINGERPRINT READER ... is a joke.  Typical google, good idea, lousy follow through",2.0 out of 5 stars
"The Android 13 is running smooth and fast on the Pixel 7 and it's a good phone at an acceptable price with preorder $100 gift card. What I missed before ordering was that it doesn't have the optical tele lens that the Pro version offers (8x Super Res Zoom[5] is software zoom only), I dodn't expect it to come without a charger - it shouldn't be too much asked to get a $10 charger with the buying of a $600 phone! And charging with a 3rd party wireless charger doesn't work for me independantly of setting adaptive charging mode or not. Hope that gets fixed later. Fingerprint sensor is worse than on my old Motorola. Still couldn't get keypass running with finger print unlock.

"My old phone is a  Pixel 3. Great phone. It was almost 5 years old. Battery life was fading, memory was limited.  So I thought I would up grade.  The Pixel 7 call quality is terrible!

"Want to use the fingerprint reader with a screen protector? Nope. I read the reviews, thought they were exaggerating. Nope. I loved the reader on the back of the phone on my 3. Why they moved out is beyond me.Also, my old Bluetooth headphones refuse to work (tozo T6). I've read you can turn the HD audio off and they MIGHT work but sound crappy. I had to buy new headphones. My old ones still work just fine with my work iphone though. So be prepared for the possibility of having to buy new headphones. :(Other than the fingerprint issue and no support for my older Bluetooth headphones, phone seems pretty perfect.

"I replaced my galaxy s20 FE with this phone. The quality of the pixel 7 is competitive to that of the leading samsung but for less money. My favorite feature my Samsung's never had is the ability to screenshot an entire page instead of having to scroll and take multiple screenshots. Also magic erasure for photos is a game changer. It works way better than Samsung's version of it. If you opt for Google apps over the vendor apps like Samsung internet, messages,email, this is the phone for you. It's simple and straight to the point without the duplicate apps.

"I'll keep this short.  I've used both Android and Apple phones for years.  My personal phone has always been an Android, and my work phone an iPhone.  I loved using both.I used Samsung through the years from the S3 all the way to the S20, which was a let down.  So I tried the Pixel 7.It's the worst phone I've ever used.  The fingerprint and face ID is useless - my iPhone has no issue at all, but the Pixel 99% of the time forces me to use a PIN.The sofware is clunky, especially the message app.But the worst yet is the design of the phone.  The cameras are raised on the back on the phone.  This means if any pressure is placed on the face of the phone, it will flex the entire phone resulting in a cracked screen.  out of a dozen phones I've previously owned I've never had a screen crack just based on usage.  The Pixel cracked within 2 months.  Its a bad design, and Google would not warranty it for me.On top of that, the camera glass is also cheap and breaks easily.  I replaced my screen and the camera lens cracked shortly afterwards.  I use a case and screen protectors, but still it somehow cracked.The iPhones I've owned have never had that issue.  Ever.  Neither did the Samsungs.As a result, I'll never buy a Pixel again.  I could go on and on about other negatives, mainly the software and interface, but will stop short since it isn't worth it.  Bad design, bad software = avoid.",Worst phone I have ever owned,1.0 out of 5 stars

"Before into the Pixel 7, I have been using an iPhone12 mini for 2 years. And a Samsung Note 9 before that. Why I chose the iPhone12 mini? Because I wanted a real compact phone. And Why I bought the Pixel 7 now? Well, 1. I want better battery life. 2. I want bigger screen for games and for navigation. 3. IOS just bored me.So, I got the Pixel 7 lemongrass 256g for 599$ and have been using it for a week now. And here are my opinions.In short words, if you have been using Android and want an upgrade now, I really recommend Pixel 7, mainly because it gives you good software experience and decent camera at a very fair price.Exterior & comfort:The color lemon grass is special and I like it. The visor camera bump looks unique and kinda cool in my opinion. The rounded edge makes the phone comfortable to hold. HOWEVER, there are some cons. 1. The bump and the glass back make it awkward to place on any flat surface. 2. The bump is a huge dust collector. 3. Although the edge of the flat screen has a bit of curve, the transition to the metal frame is not good, which means the touch of the edge areas feels a bit cheap, definitely not comparable to Note 9. Overall, I think the look is unique but comes with some sacrifices, and the build quality is fairly good for the price.Operating System:This is the first time I use the so called ""pure"" Android. Compared to Samsung's OneUI, the OS on Pixel 7 feels more like Apple's iOS actually. It doesn't have as many customization functions as OneUI and is simpler to use. Kinda like iOS, but in a different style, well, the kinda nerdy Google style. If you like it you like it. Some special Google AI features are cool, but should not be the only reason for anyone to buy this phone in my opinion. I haven't experienced many bugs. Actually, only one when switching between bluetooth audio devices that really bothers me a bit. Overall, I like the system, and I think it is good for anyone but people who have only used iPhone before.Camera:Pixel has always been famous for its camera capabilities. I must say it is true on Pixel 7. It takes very decent photos no matter the light conditions, and the shoot experience is simple and natural. Is it as good or better as flagship phones like iPhone 14 pro? I don't know, maybe not. But as someone who uses a dedicated camera for street photography, I think the camera on Pixel 7 is more than capable to take nice looking daily photos and capture those little moments into good memories. When it comes to video, it is also good, especially considering the price, but iPhone is better. And I mean iPhone 12 mini. So overall, the camera is very good.Battery life:Not much to say here since I don't bother to do any ""tests"" and have no numbers. But based on my feeling, it is good, but not as good as I expected considering the battery capacity. It will last you a full day (8 hours) or more if you use it lightly. But it is no way a two-day or 1.5 day battery life.Gaming:Gaming is trash. At least for pubg mobile. It is probably due to software issue (not optimized for Tensor chip) rather than lack of raw performance. But if you play a lot of 3D mobile games, avoid this one.Conclusion:Decent phone for the price. Actually, even for the normal price ($100 more than what I spent), it is still more than decent. If you don't want to spend that much on a phone (which is a terribly stupid trend in my opinion), this is the phone for you. Don't look at iPhone SE, that thing is a joke.",Opinion from a former iPhone user,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had this Google Pixel 7 phone now for about 8 months, after having used Samsung phones for years. The #1 best thing if you switch from Samsung is the absence of all that bloatware, those apps you never use and can't uninstall either. This phone saves so much memory by just not having those apps, and it makes it easier to sort through the apps you do have and find the one you need quickly and efficiently. Huge relief, and that's probably the #1 reason I wouldn't go back to Samsung. Photography is my hobby and for the first time this year, I did not use my SLR camera at all. I feel bad but the camera on this phone was versatile enough for my purposes! Picture quality is excellent. The magic eraser feature in editing is quite a game changer. The fact that the phone saves photos directly to your Google drive is also nice though sharing pics to social media from there isn't that straightforward. I do it all the time but I haven't figured out how to post multiple pics without them appearing in backward order. The biggest negative for the Google Pixel 7 phone is that I need to charge it just about every day. Keep in mind that I don't use it for gaming or listening to music or watching videos. I literally just use it to text, call, google stuff, occasionally for social media, and maps if I'm driving which isn't every day. Even so, I have to charge it approximately every 30 hours. This is the one thing they need to change on this phone. I have a 2022 model and it looks like I'll be getting updates until 2026 which gives them enough time to work on that! The other thing is that fingerprint recognition rarely works. When it does seem to work, I think it's actually the facial recognition thing that comes on at the same time that's opening the phone. Facial recognition works great fortunately. Oh, and just for kicks: the feature I like best that the phone comes with is ""Now Playing"" that identifies what song is currently playing. I put it on my home screen so that I don't have to switch on my phone to activate it. Just a light touch and it tells me what the mystery song I'm hearing in a cafe or on the radio is. My 20-yr-old nephew who is an iPhone user was actually envious of this feature! It's not an app -- it's just a feature that appears in Settings>Sound. To summarize: do I like this phone and would I recommend it? A resounding yes. Should battery life be improved? Also a resounding yes.","No bloatware, nice camera, but battery life is short",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm coming off a Galaxy S10 and before that an LG G6. I've also purchased Samsung A51 and S20 FE's for my parents. To get the negatives out of way. Side or rear mounted finger print sensors are so much more consistent. Samsung also provides a lot of applications that can be pretty nice like their SoundAssistant app where I can change how the volume button increments/decrements.Using the Firefox app, I can do screenshots that scroll the page on the Samsungs while on this Pixel Mozilla needs to update their app to implement the Google API to support scrolling screenshots and there are probably other apps that I would be able to do scrolling+stitched  screenshots on the Samsungs but not this Pixel. There are other things like more options in the long press context menus that make doing things faster on the Samsung compared to the Google Pixels.Default launcher on the Pixel has this full width data/weather/info widget that you can't remove. It only takes up a little less than a third of the width of the screen. It is a waste of space. If I need the date, I just swipe open the notification menu. Weather, I used the Google weather widget on my Samsung Galaxy but the smallest one that takes up like 2 horizontal app icon widths so I can fit 2 more icons on the row. The button to clear all in the task switcher, you have to swipe all the way to left end rather than just having it always there as a lower row under the application windows. AnnoyingEvery default launcher these days do gestures for going back and opening the app/multitasking switcher. I've tried for years and always go back to enabling the bottom menu with the back, home, and task switcher buttons.Gaming and emulation performance on the Qualcomm based Samsungs are a lot better. Samsung provides 1 more year of support compared to Google. Honestly almost everything is better with a Samsung phone than a Pixel. But they are expensive. If I do get into phone games and emulation more though, I'll probably go back to a Qualcomm based Samsung device unless the future AMD GPU Exynos Tensor have drivers as mature and with application developer support like Qualcomm chipsets do.Outside of all that, aesthetically it looks really nice. They made the buttons in the notification menu way bigger (slower to use than the industrial looking small icons in the Samsung default launcher). Only fits 4 quick actions before having to swipe down fully to get 8 quick actions - swipe left/right for more. For some reason google combined the wi-fi and mobile networks toggle into one so you have to click it, then click the radio button to turn off the wi-fi. Some of the notification collapsing into applications make some app notification utilities more annoying to use toThe fingerprint reader. You may have to redo your fingerprints a couple times to get it well responsive. It's good for me now. Still fails far more often than my previous phones. End up having to use pattern unlock.Google lens is nice. Fast to get to do the camera point at stuff and it translates. Could already do that with the Google Translate app on any phone. I'm happy with the battery life. I know it's better on the S23. I've gotten used to this 6.3"" disaplay. Not sure if I'd prefer a 6.1"" display. Phone is real smooth besides games. Tried DraStic, Citra, and Tower of Fantasy. Tower of Fantasy performance is not great. DraStic and Citra have surprisingly crashed on me.I was thinking I would hype this phone up compared to Samsung phones but it hasn't worked out that way. The main thing is really the aesthetics of the phone. I suppose the camera is nice and faster but I have Sony A7III and for photos compositions matter more than gear. I'm not blown away by camera performance compared to a S10E or what I see from people with iPhones and newer Galaxy phones. Low light performance is definitely miles of an upgrade over an S10E. Still, photography is all about composition and lighting and what you do in Darktable/Lightroom.I miss the 3.5mm port. I use bluetooth in the car for a different device so I needed 3.5mm adapter to connect audio to my car. At home my bluetooth audio is a class D amplifier and over ear Sony noice cancelling headphones. Sometimes I'm laying down and just want to put on some 3.5mm earbuds. I need another USB-C to 3.5mm adapter so I don't have to keep remembering to carry the one in my car everywhere. I don't think I'll get over the loss of 3.5mm jacks because of how much audio equipment I have. I'm never buying those Google Airpod knockoffs nor the Samsung ones.After having this phone for a month and then writing this review, I don't notice the visual UI aesthetics anymore. It's not truly a plus for me anymore. I've gotten over it. It's a good phone but Samsung does an extra year of major OS and security updates over Google. The Google Tensor is already not as good as Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 let alone the 8 Gen 2. I can wait one year and potentially buy the 1 year old Galaxy phone with a better chipset for the price of a new Pixel. Buying this 256GB version for $600 when the Samsung S23 was going for $800 is nice thoughWanted to overall positive with the review. Still really good phone because modern phones are all overall hit all the basics - even the cheap phones. If the future Tensor processors with AMD GPUs aren't competitive with Samsungs in gaming/emulation support, the only reason I'd be buying a Pixel is the price.",Better Value than a Galaxy S23,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I got my Pixel 7 a few days ago from Amazon and I have to say I'm impressed. I'm upgrading from a OnePlus 6T, so keep that in mind when reading my review. I haven't had any problems. powering it up the first time and transferring all my data from my old phone worked like a charm (better than on my wife's Pixel 6A, which had a couple of glitches during the process). Setup took a while, mainly because I have a ton of apps that I needed to sign on to. I've got almost everything done now, except for the most annoying apps (Okta verify, I'm looking at you). The only issue I had during setup was turning WiFi calling on--it failed twice, then I realized the bad reception in my basement was to blame. When I did it from my living room, where reception is good, it turned on without a problem.In daily use, the phone has worked flawlessly. Face unlock is fast (albeit not as secure as a fingerprint because it only uses the regular camera, unlike on the iPhone). The fingerprint reader has yet to fail to recognize my finger, and it's faster than the one on my old OnePlus. The phone feels snappier than my old one, particularly when running certain apps that slowed down my old phone (Instacart, for example).The screen is a beauty--coming from a 60Hz screen, 90Hz is a noticeable upgrade and feels buttery smooth. It's bright enough to use easily in direct sunlight.The camera is very good, from what I can tell. Definitely way better than my old phone's. I haven't taken many night or low-light shots yet, but everything else has come out looking great.I know the Pixel 6 was glitchy and, in some cases, got buggier as time went on. Fingers crossed this won't happen with the 7, but so far so good.Overall, I can't believe the amount of stuff the phone has to offer for the price, particularly with the $100 gift card pre-order offer. It's a flagship phone for a mid-tier price. I was considering getting an iPhone 13, but opted for the Pixel 7 because of the lower price. I'm glad I made that choice, as that extra $$$ comes in handy these days.Edit to add that the battery life is good, but not great. It lasts through a whole day of moderate to heavy use and has about 20% left at the end of the day.","Snappy performance, fluid screen, great cameras, excellent value for the money",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I previously had the Google Pixel 3XL and loved it. I constantly gushed about how great their phones were. So how, in just a couple years, has Google managed to completely screw up a good thing?The first issue, which seems to be problematic for many users, is the fingerprint sensor. It used to be on the back of the phone and worked flawlessly. Someone decided to put it on the front screen and it doesn't work at all. The phone rarely to never recognizes that I have even picked it up - so I need to hit the power button just to get my sign on screen. Once there it gives me the fingerprint sensor. I touch it. It recognizes the touch ( I can feel the phone vibrate), but it will NOT unlock. I touch it again. Nada. AGAIN. Still NOTHING. After trying the sensor at least 3 times (getting the vibration each time) it then simply gives me a PIN screen and then I need to manually enter my PIN (with my old phone I would already be browsing the internet or speaking to whomever I was calling). Once I have the screen open, the active edge is gone, so I can no longer squeeze the phone and request to call someone. I set up the voice command ""Google assistant"" to help shorten the frustration. I give the command ""Hey Google"" and then have to wait for the assistant. When it finally responds and I give my command, it tells me it cannot find that person in my contacts (even though they are there). So then I have to fiddle with that. By the time I deal with all of this and get a call through, I would have already had a conversation and hung up with my 3XL. Yes, I have adjusted the sensitivity settings. Additionally, when I am browsing websites, I have to repeatedly touch links, commands, etc. You can tell that the phone is recognizing the touch (by either vibration or it highlights whatever I am clicking on), but it doesn't ""launch"" anything (for lack of proper terminology). So, I end up sitting on a page, repeatedly trying to click on things to open it, all to no avail. By the time I fight the fingerprint sensor and manage to get to a website, it's nearly impossible to navigate the website. It also takes longer for pages to open or respond (whether I am on wi-fi or data). The extra time it takes to do the simplest tasks is absolutely maddening.I also set up the face recognition so that I could just skip the darn fingerprint sensor, but that works maybe 10-20% of the time (if I am lucky).Scrolling between windows was also nearly impossible. Just like the fingerprint sensor, it rarely to never recognized my attempts to slide up to scroll my windows/pages. Most of the time it wouldn't recognize the request to scroll. I finally found a setting that gave me a ""three button navigation"" (back arrow, home button and to scroll windows). I can't say I love it, but at least I can navigate.It has multiple other glitches that make me crazy. I was listening to Pandora and closed it. The music continued to play. I tried mutiple way to close it. I ended up closing ALL windows (even though I didn't want to and shouldn't have had to) and the music was still playing. WTH?! I couldn't find a way to turn it off. I finally told Google Assistant to ""Close Pandora!"" and it finally did. These are just a couple of issues, I've only had the phone for a couple of days so I suspect my list will grow longer each day.  My dogs hate the phone more than I do because I spend most of my day yelling and cursing at my phone while my dogs run for cover. I've seriously come close to pitching this thing across the room.I was the biggest Google phone fan already, so this should have been a slam dunk - but Google laid an egg with this one. If you're listening Google, here is a suggestion; ""If it ain't broke - don't fix it.""****Adding more as I find more.I'm also finding it impossible to set a different notification sound for email and text messages. Why, for the love of God, would anyone from Google feel the need to do that? This is a major frustration for me. I don't want ONE notification sound for ALL of my alerts.Opening pages takes longer than my old 3XL as well. My new.phone has twice the memory, so it's certainly not that.Everything with this phone takes twice as long to accomplish with twice the frustration.I also use Google's texting app (which I had on my 3XL as well). Now, on my 7, if you accidentally archive a chat, the ""un-do"" button at the bottom has disappeared and takes many more steps to retrieve it. If it sounds like I am venting all of my frustrations with Google, you would be correct. I'm hoping someone from Google reads this review, takes it to a developers meeting and revisits these poor decisions. Until then, I'll be waiting for updates to resolve these issues and will update my review accordingly.",How could Google go this wrong?,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I love my pixel. I was in the Android world long before I got this phone but this experience tops it all. Don't be fooled thinking that this phone is perfect, because it is far from it and I'll try to break down the pros and cons:Pros:-Android experience: no bloatware and updates directly from Google-Camera: the camera unit itself might not be the most powerful in terms of hardware, but the post-processing software that google has implemented makes it one of the best in the game.-Battery life: The phone learns from your usage habits and adapts the battery's performance to adjust to your needs. The phone felt like it lacked the power the first couple of weeks, but now I get a day's use easily.-Looks: The finish on the back is a fingerprint magnet, but you can't deny that it looks amazing. The camera bump helps protect the back from scratches (I mean at least in the 5 seconds that you'll have it out of the case for cleaning)Cons:-Fingerprint reader: No matter how you register the fingerprint, it will fail to recognize it in a sunny day or when you are in the dark. I've tried to register 2 or 3 times in different lighting conditions, but the sensor itself is lacking in recognition capabilities.-Screen: 90Hz is enough for the untrained eye, but I just wish the max brightness was a bit higher.-Facial recognition: I wish the phone was improved in the face unlock area. I mean if you are not going to use a good fingerprint reader, might as well add more facial reading capabilities or add IR sensors to make unlocking the phone more secure.Take this in consideration when buying and if the drawbacks are not a deal-breaker for you, you won't regret getting this pixel.","First pixel, but not my last...",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Waited to make this review till I had a reasonable time period of use behind me. I purchased this phone to replace a near four year old one and I have not been disappointed since. Key positives for me thus far -1. Best battery life of any phone I have ever owned. A full day is normal with moderate use (I only charge up to 80% as well). I can probably get 2 days of use with light use.2. Camera is very good. I am not a photophile by an means but the picture quality, colour depth, etc are all quite exceptional. There are also useful pic edit tools available via Google that makes editing easy.3. Despite not having the flagship Snapdragon chip like all my previous handsets I am not noticing any lag or performance issues. The phone is responsive and quite fast.4. The speech recorder to text function has bee na godsend in a few meetings I have been in and needed notes done. Works very wellI have not activated the face recognition feature as I never liked it as a security access so I can't speak to it but the underscreen fingerprint sensor works well. I had to remove the tempered glass protector for it to work well though.At the price paid I am happy with the phone.",Good Value,5.0 out of 5 stars
"As a longtime user of Pixel phones, I can't help but keep coming back to them even when I try a different phone, except this time.While the Pixel 7 continues to be one of the best value options on the market, my Pixel arrived with a faint but noticeable screen defect in which there were three shadow-like gray areas in the top, middle, and bottom portions of the screen that were very noticeable on bright backgrounds. This annoyed me when scrolling through apps or webpages and seeing text fade through these ""gray zones"" that I couldn't make go away- and this was from a brand new unit that I only had for a few days. Aside from my screen defect, the Pixel 7 was still a great phone.When it comes to the software experience, the clean Android experience is still one of the best that you can get, in addition to also being the first to get new Android updates as they roll out. The color themes that you can choose based on your wallpaper adds another level to customization, and you can even apply these colors to some app icons as well. The software is smooth, and I haven't had any of the software bugs that some others have had. However, what really makes the Pixel experience great are some of the features you can't get on other Android phones such as Google's ""screen call"", ""hold for me"", photo unblur, and magic erase options. My favorite of these is definitely screen call, as when enabled you can have the Pixel automatically answer the call for you and give you a transcript based on the call to let you know whether you should pick up or not in case it is spam. I get a lot of Spam calls personally, so this has saved me the hassle of having to take a lot of unnecessary calls. When it comes to the photo modes, the magic eraser works great when there isn't too much going on, but the photo unblur ability isn't that great. I found that even photos that are only slightly blurred sometimes just get added sharpness from this mode, but without actually unblurring the parts of the photo I needed. My overall favorite part of the default android experience though, is the Google toolbar on the bottom of your homepage. While on the Pixel this bar is not removable, I found it to be the best implementation out of any android phone as it not only allows you to search Google whenever you need, but it also searches your device for apps, videos, and more that might be stored on it. Think of it as an all-in-one search that not only searches the web, but searches your device as well as giving you recommendations based on your recently used apps.Aside from software, the main reason why I have always used Pixel phones is the camera. While the Pixel 7 does have some improvements to the larger sensor, all of the magic still happens on the software processing side. Even photos that may not look like they will be good before pressing the shutter, will look like a professional photo as soon as it is captured and finished processing. This is what the Pixel does best. No matter what phone I use, whether Android-wise or iPhone, the photos produced by the Pixel series are still the best I've ever seen and used. Photos just pop with a well balanced blend of saturation, color, lighting, and sharpness that looks natural to real life. Selfies are the same as well. Despite the front selfie camera being a lower megapixel camera compared to the rear sensor, it still produces great photos and the portrait mode is one of the best on a smartphone. However, while the Pixel 7 captures great photos, it still needs some work on the video side. Videos are an improvement over previous generations, but videos still need a lot of light to look good. When in a well-lit room or outside on a sunny day, the videos are vivid, detailed, clear, and sharp, but as soon as the lights start to dim, the videos will return to a noisy mess. For videos, the iPhone still remains supreme, in my opinion, but the next gen Pixel just might close the gap on the video side.When it comes to battery life, it is a bit of a mixed bag. The Pixel 7 had very mediocre battery life in the first day or two that I had it, with it not lasting more than 4-5 hours on a full charge for me. However, by day 3, the battery life nearly doubled as the adaptive battery feature noticed the apps I was using and optimized itself for a better experience. The phone charges at an average rate and still doesn't charge very fast over wired or wireless chargers, but it is still good enough to fully charge it in a bit over an hour when plugged in directly.When it comes to performance, the Tensor 2 is a powerhouse, but it still doesn't even come close to the newer Snapdragon Flagship chips from the last couple of years. Games can still be a bit stuttery and laggy at times, and you may have to lower some settings for a smooth experience. However, it is still a very capable chip and I would still say it is 2nd best after the Snapdragon.The display is something that is still a mixed bag as although I received a defective unit with my ""gray zones'', the OLED panel used on the non-Pro variants still continues to be much lower quality than the LTPO panels used on the Pro version. While the refresh rate can still go up to 90Hz and is a significant improvement over 60Hz panels, my primary complaint is actually about the fact that the brightness is significantly lower even at max levels and has way more noticeable color shifting when tilting the phone screen to the sides. While it is an OLED panel that still delivers vibrant colors and rich blacks, I just wish it had at least a 1st gen LTPO panel or a higher quality AMOLED than what is being used. While these complaints may seem unwarranted because my display was defective, this was an issue with the Pixel 6 as well when it came to using a lower quality panel compared to the Pro. As someone who has also used the A-series of Pixel phones, the displays on those budget options are nearly identical in quality to the Pixel 7, just with a faster refresh rate on 7 itself.Overall, while the phone itself is still the best value for the money, I was disappointed that my brand new unit had such a big flaw with the display. I've never had this issue with Pixel phones before and it really impacted my opinion of Google's quality for the time being. Aside from that, I still highly recommend this phone to those who want a nearly full flagship phone experience but without spending more than is needed. In terms of photos and software, it is the best there is, but for gaming, productivity, and videos, it still needs some improvements.",Pixel Phones are Still King but Mine Had Flaws,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Update 2/19/23. So last update Amazon graciously gave me a very fair partial refund even though it was outside the 2 month window. (I owned the phone for 4 mos and 2 days) And I have sent the pixel 7 back to them. Google customer service continues to be abysmal. Overall phone was not better than pixel 2 for me, but aside from all my issues still a decent value and I still like Pixel phones better than the competition. Read on if you desire to see my trials and tribulations with the Pixel 7. So I finally got around to working through the warranty process (for cracked rear camera lens) with Google and was put in touch with a local ubreakit/wefixit shop who promptly told me it wasn't covered(incidental damage). I was quoted $249 to repair. I declined and contacted Amazon again who proceeded to offer me a very fair partial refund which I accepted and sent the phone back. I am back to using my pixel 2 which still works better for me, while I regroup and figure out what is next. Thanks Amazon you are absolutely fantastic you didn't have to make this right and you did, so thanks,  and if you make a smartphone I would love to buy it. Google customer service your lucky I still like the pixel because you are absolutely atrocious to work with.Update 1/14/23 on the plus side it appears that the USB c port issues were software related, it stopped having issues after the last update. So that is a win.I contacted Amazon about the broken camera lens it appears this is a common issue on Pixel 7s due to a manufacturing error in producing the glass. Apparently they shatter due to internal stress. Amazon told me that they couldn't help me because it was outside the 2 month return window. But it has a one year warranty by Google. I reached out to Google for the warranty claim and I received an email from a company lawyer saying if I was sueing them about the issue they have received my information and would email me back. I haven't heard anything since. I imagine I will have to contact them again. But only the wide angle camera is affected and I don't use that. So overall I am actually pretty happy with this phone. And now that the USB c port works again it does everything I need. I hear pixel 8 is smaller so will see when that one comes out. Adding a star because everything I care about works now. Google customer service sucks, but still wouldn't pay $1200 for a comparable iphone or Samsung.Update 12/3/22I have started having issues with the USB C port it doesn't grab the cable tightly and causes issues with Android auto and often if I attempt to charge by cable it will appear to be charging and than won't. I have cleaned it out, but no obvious debris. I bought this first day available and received it October 17, so not quite two months. I have worked around this using a wireless charger but still data xfer and android auto are a problem.Additionally I bought and use a Spigen case and screen protector, but I pulled it out of my pocket and found the glass shattered above the camera lens.  I am guessing that I leaned against something with it in my pocket but I didn't drop it or violate it in an obvious manner.  I definitely need a phone that I can carry in my pocket and that is adequately protected with a case and screen protector although a nice phone maybe not durable enough for me. Never had an issue with pixel 2 on the durability front.Fortunately both the camera and phone still work but definitely not tracking for another four year performance.Original review -I have been using this phone for a little over a month. I upgraded from a pixel 2.Pros- Good battery life, updates and is supported for the next 3 years.Cons-Significantly larger than pixel 2, fingerprint scanner is almost unusable.There is a lot of reviews on the cameras and how great they are, I'm sure they are excellent for my uses the pixel 2 was more than adequate and this one is also more than adequate.The fingerprint reader is a problem, the pixel 2 worked almost flawlessly for the 4 years I used it every day. The pixel 7 might work 2 out of 10 times maybe 1 out of ten, it is so inconsistent that I really can't use it for biometric authentication. I have read the fixes and troubleshooting, none of it really works, I'm not going to carry a fingerprint wetter around with me.I think a lot of the things that drove me to upgrade, were do to Google refusing to support the Pixel 2 it received its last update at the end of 2020 and it started a few months ago to experience buggy performance with connectivity and the GPS, with no real fixes due to being two revs behind on Android.For me the fingerprint scanner and size combined with a brand new pixel 2, makes it a better phone than the pixel 7. Unfortunately I can't go back in time and can only hope that in four years pixel 12 is smaller and has a functional fingerprint scanner.The 7 is a good phone and at $500 it is an excellent value. They certainly have upgraded the cameras and the tensor system works well. I certainly am glad I went this route over the other options.I just think there is a point where some of the driving features, cameras, operating systems, weird swipe modes etc are really not noticeably better and drive up cost and size and lead to removal of things I would like such as a stand alone fingerprint scanner and 3.5 mm jack. Hope Google reads this","Amazon is excellent, Google customer service not so much.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"The phone features are really nice; however, the fingerprint reader is terrible. It takes away from all the good and makes it a very frustrating experience.

"Initially, I thought it was an ok phone, but as time went on, the phone started having all kinds of glitches and errors.  The keyboard is way too small & the audio is crap.  Now, Google limits storage to only 15 gigs of storage, which means unless you purchase more storage for an additional monthly fee.  Google Also now does regular forced upgrades, which takes up a lot of storage. If you try to decline the Google upgrade, Google does not allow you Continued use of their app until you agree to the upgrade.Thank God I still have two practically new Samsung cell phones, which I plan to transfer my cell service back to and throw this piece of crap Pixel 7 in the trash were it belongs.  I will no longer be at the mercy of Google. Samsung cloud will be my main storage and day to day function of my cell phone.Google will go back to only being used as a search engine tool.Also, note this phone is so slippery and cracks extremely easily that Samsung heavy duty plastic phone.

"I bought the phone in May 2023 and by the end of the year the volume button had fallen out, I figured it wasn't worth warranting just for that so just put up with it, but around the end of January I started getting ghost touches and occasional total unresponsiveness, a few days after that started I noticed that the top left of the screen was separating from the chassis. I thought oh well, it's covered by warranty and contacted support, they said I either had to drive an hour+ to uBreakIfix or mail it in, which could take weeks. I needed it fixed asap so I decided to make the drive only to be told that they can warranty it because the volume buttons had fallen out, which apparently constitutes ""physical damage"". So I contacted support twice, once to be told that it's not covered under warranty and there is nothing they can do, and again to be told ""I'll get back to you within 24hrs"".And I would think that maybe this is a lemon but this is the third pixel I've had and they've all died from faulty hardware, this one from the aforementioned issues and the others (both Pixel 4 XLs) from the battery voltage sensor failing, which prevents safe charging.",Google can't seem to get their hardware together,1.0 out of 5 stars
"The Pixel 7 128GB phone is awful. I have had it for six months now and it just keeps getting worse. My biggest problem is the phone overheating with just a couple of minutes of use when using mobile data instead of wi-fi. This started happening more and more often after the December 2023 update and now the phone is pretty much unusable if I'm not using wi-fi. It also shuts down randomly, sometimes mid-call.Google support is not helpful -- instead of addressing the issue, they recommend that I not use phone apps while on mobile data or to stop using it when it gets hot. This does nothing for me. There's a big online community complaining about everything listed here.Additionally, the camera is not as good as I expected. My initial huge complaint -- the fingerprint sensor not really working -- has been dwarfed by all that is wrong with it now. I'm so disappointed.My previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy S10E that I bought in 2019. I'd rather have that five-year-old phone again instead of this one.

"I got this phone for my wife since she loved her Pixel5. At first we loved, it... but then once she had our toddler attempt talk to me on her Pixel 7,  we started to hate it. We tried all possible settings, it just cuts out high pitch voices, and it's baffling that it's something specific to Pixel 7/pro/a.Look it up, the Pixel 7 has a broken AI that cancels out kids voices or anyone with high pitched voices. There's been reports since 2022 and they partially fixed it in June of 2023 but it's still an issue!As a fan of google, and professional that deals with technology; this is so disappointing. Why don't they just give us the option to turn the AI canceling off...  The only work around we've found is to contact people with high pitched voices/kids using google duo/meet or things like that.Google developers must be napping in their park pods and not doing their work....

"I was excited to migrate away from Samsung Galaxy for the first time in YEARS (S5, S7, S9, S20 FE) to try something new, so I decided to give the Pixel 7 a try.The first thing I noticed is the fingerprint scanner on this phone is terrible. I took 6 attempts to register my first fingerprint because every previous attempt ""timed out"". Once I actually got one registered, it would successfully scan 1/5 times. This was without a screen protector and after adjusting various settings. The root of the issue is the fingerprint scanner on this phone is a cheap optical sensor. The ultrasonic sensor on my Galaxy S20 FE performs MUCH better with rarely a failed scan. I use the fingerprint scanner for login on several apps, so this was a major issue.The next issue is the static assistant widget that takes up the top app row on the home screen. Most of the time half of this area is empty. This ""feature"" cannot be removed or moved to a different screen.Next, recent updates added a static Google search bar above the anchored app row at the bottom of the screen. This also is unable to be removed.Finally, the 3-button navigation is reversed compared to the Galaxy layout (i.e. back button on bottom left on Pixel, bottom right on Galaxy). It would be a simple fix to make this navigation bar reversible, but Google hasn't implemented this feature though it has been a popular customer ask.My Pixel 7 is being returned, and I will revert to my Galaxy for the time being.",Too many Google features forced on the user.

I had the phone mounted on my handle bars and angled so that I could see the screen and the angling limited the amount of water that could accumulate. Despite all of this water entered and destroyed the phone.This phone should not be called IP68. It doesn't resist water but consumers assume that it does and that leads to damaged phones.

"The Pixel 4a was perfect for me. Small size, everything works as it should and it has a world class fingerprint scanner. The only reason I replaced it was because Google no longer updates it with the latest & greatest. I put off buying this phone because it's bigger and heavier than my 4a (very important to me), and I read so many negative reviews concerning facial & fingerprint scanning. Well, it sucks that it's bigger & heavier, but the facial recognition works very well, except in the dark, and the fingerprint scanner is reliable but slower. I need to press it firmly to unlock, whereas a little tap was all that was required from the 4a. I can easily live with it. The camera is improved, mostly from the different lenses.

"I recently had the misfortune of purchasing the Google Pixel 7, and I must say that it has been an absolute disaster from the moment I took it out of the box. This supposed ""flagship"" device couldn't even get past the activation phase without causing me endless frustration.First and foremost, the activation process was an utter nightmare. It seemed as if the Pixel 7 was designed to make the simple act of setting up a new phone an impossible task. No matter how many times I followed the instructions, the device failed to activate properly. It continuously displayed error messages, leaving me clueless about what went wrong. This lack of clarity and the absence of any helpful troubleshooting steps added to my frustration.To make matters worse, when I somehow managed to bypass the activation phase after numerous attempts, the setup process turned into a crash fest. Yes, you heard it right. The Pixel 7 crashed not once, but twice during the setup process. It was as if the device was determined to ruin my entire day. I was left staring at a blank screen, wondering why on earth I decided to give Google another chance.The fact that a flagship smartphone like the Pixel 7 couldn't handle the most basic functionalities without crashing is mind-boggling. It showcases a complete lack of quality control and highlights the haphazard development process that Google seems to have adopted.Furthermore, the absence of any helpful customer support during this nightmare experience only exacerbated my frustration. When I reached out to Google for assistance, I was met with vague and unhelpful suggestions that did nothing to resolve the activation and setup issues. It was as if they didn't even care about their own product's failure.Considering the exorbitant price tag associated with the Pixel 7, one would expect a seamless and hassle-free experience. Unfortunately, that was far from reality. This device not only failed to live up to its promises but also proved to be a massive waste of time and money.In conclusion, I cannot stress enough how deeply disappointed I am with the Google Pixel 7. Its inability to surpass the activation phase, coupled with multiple crashes during setup, left me feeling frustrated and regretful. Save yourself the headache and steer clear of this abysmal device.",STEER CLEAR DONT BUY THIS PHONE,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was Very excited about this photo. My husband came from a Galaxy Note Ultra (the last one from manufacturer before it got discontinued). I came from an Iphone 12 pro max. Prior to those, we both had Lg G7 and we both still miss it.My pro max was reaching it expiration -battery issues mainly - and my husband is very hard on phone screens.He got the 7pro version and it works Very well for him. I don't do curved screens. We got the phones during the 'switch and get $200 credit per line' thing with Verizon. Out the door mine was pretty much paid for because we also had some down payment. We switched in the.. Christmas time frame.For a few months mine was fine. Call quality was much better than with the 12 pro max. What I needed worked good.Few months after, small stuff started to be weird:Lack of audio: on videos, music, etc. It would take fiddling with the volume settings to get it going. finger print sensor:  may as well not be an option. I have by now reset the finger prints several times and it still doesn't recognize any fingers.I've given up on it. pin to unlock the phone:  started being weird. I could not get the lock screen to slid UP to access the pin screen with one hand. I had to put the phone down and focus on very specific motion and still I'd sometimes have to restart the phone.Answering phone calls + spam recondition:  Mixed with spam recognition. It forgets what numbers are saved and mixes them up with spam.  I won't get voicemails for a few days - had that issue with apple as well-.I have issues with the screen cooperating to answer calls it does permit to go through as saved numbers.It doesn't permit many calls to even ring before stating the call is missed quite often.When I do get to answer, the audio is faulty. typing pad: for typing anything is now weird. It won't get the letter correct that I'm pressing. If it does, it decides what word I want and it's usually wrong. Sometimes one letter is correct but a different one is not even nearby the letter I'm pressing.With alerts:I won't get an alert for a message whether through FB messenger, or telegram or the actual phones messaging system. If I do, it gives me the SAME alert, especially with fb messenger.Speakers: they do the job. Nothing fancy.Photos: I'm not picky so that doesn't bother me. Finding photos is a challenge because of how they get categorized.Volume button: worked really well for a while. This past week it's started being either very very sensitive or unresponsive 🤔🤔 it's very strange.Summary: Again. I have only  been using this phone since Mid December last year 2022. It's not even a full year old. It's barely past it's first 6 months and was BRAND new from the box from the Verizon store. I did not care about Color because every phone goes directly into the phone case. For this phone, due to it's newness.... I had the option of one otter box style and another brand my husband uses. I chose the otter box. It's done the job very well. I drop this phone often and the screen looks like new.  I do not mess with refurbished phones. I've been down the road of T-Mobile AND Sprint 'get this phone free with us' and each time, with the acception of the LG G7, it's been a nightmare. This is proving similar.This has been my experience. I am hoping to trade it in for something else. I don't know what to try next but contemplating going back to Iphone. The downside Android is that it's... Often experimental vs just... Working.  I have also been down the road of pay as you go phone providers and their versions of phones. That has also been a night mare. I just wish phones WORKED and so far, my two best experiences have been the LG G7 and the iphone 12 pro max.I hoped this gives some insight into what could go wrong. It might just be my phone. YouTube reviewers seem to credit this as a good phone for the price. I'll let whoever reads this decide that. I wanted to leave my experience, though.I'm currently having to restart my phone a couple times per week so basic things function with mediocrity.Actually the only decent thing on this phone is the ability to fully silence it / control what stuff makes noise when audio does want to work and the battery life is better than I expected. Compared to my iphone 12 pro max it's terrible. That photo has amazing battery life 😳😳 I had very few complaints about that phone.","Seems most love it, I have another tale to tell",1.0 out of 5 stars

"I have no idea how some people give this phone a decentish review. This is a good phone as long as you don't mind connectivity so awful that you get no reception in situations when everyone else does; think that fingerprint readers will mature as a technology in 2-3 years; and don't mind carrying an extra battery around in case you run out of power by the early evening.I purchased this phone directly from Google in November 2022. It replaced a $150 dual-sim Motorola phone that turned out to be this one's vast superior in each of the three criteria I list above. The reason I changed was because my new US cell phone carrier used a bandwidth that my European-bought dual-sim Motorola did not have.My go back and forth between NY and Berlin, and I have had for many years the same Deutsche Telekom plan there, which is rated best for reception throughout Germany. With my Motorola, I had consistent reception inside thick-walled buildings and on subway platforms, and even on most subway lines; when I did not get reception between stations, I would immediately get it at the subway stop and could send emails, etc. But with this phone, in locations where everyone else gets reception, I fail to get anything at all. Even at subway stations (all of which are set up to have good reception), this phone is too slow to find the connection before the train starts to travel to the next station, which means that a 45-minute commute could end up totally reception-less. This is also the case in NY, even after I finally switched to GoogleFi, thinking that maybe that might improve reception on their own phone.The battery life is absolutely deplorable. I never listen to music on my phone and very rarely watch any videos, instead reading on it maybe 2 to 2.5 hours a day during commutes, and yet by 7 or 8 pm, I  usually get a low battery warning and need to switch to a mode that kills off 5G. If I have to meet a friend later and don't have an extra battery with me, I put the phone in battery saver mode early in the day so that I can be sure to have it working later in the evening.And then there is the fingerprint ""reader"" (if that's what it can be called). It's so awful that I finally ended up scanning the same thumb for all the available finger slots just so as to improve the chance of it working from time to time from time to time, which it does. For me, it works maybe 60% of the time now. My Motorola and my Samsung before that were flawless on this count.What's good about this phone? It does take nice pictures! There must be something else but I'm forgetting now.I spent so much time switching everything to this phone (especially high-security things that are tethered to your specific phone).

"having had many issues with my first google hardware ever, a pixel 6, I thought I might have gotten a lemon so I upgraded to 7. I still have the same issues so at least now I know it was not just my device. Here are some of the issues:- Freezing randomly for no apparent reason. sometimes shutting down and restarting the app fixes it and some times the whole phone needed power cycling.- screen is either too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Sometimes mildly touching the screen to scroll down through my text messages actually archives my texts without me sliding left or right at all. I have deleted stuff like that too.- when watching video on YouTube or other sites turning the phone 90 degree to go to full screen works one out of ten tries. I have to turn it over and over and aggressively too until it works or just give in and click to go full screen at which point it could go full screen but up side down.- While watching a video, the phone minimizes the screen randomly out of nowhere. It vibrates sometimes as it does that.- THIS ONE IS THE MOST ANOYING ONE: when I get a phone call sometimes the phone rings but doesn't give me the button you touch to pickup the phone. As a matter of fact it doesn't show nothing but whatever was already on the screen and you only know someone is calling cause it's ringing. I have to let it ring till it's disconnected and then look up the missed call and call them back which in some cases could ruin your life if you're waiting for an important call; the kind that takes missing a call as an indicator of your character.- The battery and camera still can't touch the iphone. actually nothin on this is even close to an iphone. worse, my kid's Motorola that I bought for 3rd of the price of pixel is a much better phone.There are many more little things here and there that I can't write about now but all I can say is that I doubt if I ever touch Google hardware again. I feel Google has complicated things not just in hardware but in other areas too. Camera aside, my old LG Android from 4 years ago did everything better than this pixel 7.  Considering the fact that my old phone had a real headphone jack, SD card slot and changeable battery, I think the old and cheap phone would win over this one hands down regardless of the fancier camera. why did I thing a Google phone would do better while running the Google's OS!!??!!",**READ 1st before wasting good money**,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Had to return the Pixel 7 because of frustratingly bad fingerprint sensor and poor half-day battery life. Don't know if this was an issue with my specific piece but I've seen plenty of similar complaints on other forums like reddit. Very disappointing since I'd had a Pixel 2 back when and enjoyed using it despite it's small battery. Google should ensure that their products don't have such obvious quality of life defects like the fingerprint sensor working only 5% of the time. I didn't expect Google to fix this issue in an update since it's been a while since the phone's release and they still haven't done so. So, I returned the phone and bought a Zenfone 9 instead, which has a physical capacitive fingerprint reader (works 100% of the time), much better battery performance, and isn't too heavy or cumbersome to hold either (which the Pixel 7 unfortunately was). The only thing the Pixel line has going for itself is the camera and others are catching up.P.S. Pixels don't have very good customization now. It's impossible to get rid of or even move the ""At A Glance"" widget on the homescreen. It takes up the entire top section. It might only be useful for people who have the Google nest ecosystem set up. But a traditional customizable clock, alarm, weather widget would've been more useful. Now, if one wants all that, they have to set up a second widget which makes the home screen look clunky and absurd. Also, the new customization options in stock android with wallpaper themed color schemes are extremely bland and it's hard to set your own preferred colors. So you're left only with options for very muted, unappealing, boring color schemes.","Faulty fingerprint sensor, battery life below expectations",1.0 out of 5 stars

The cameras have been great, nevertheless, the build quality is terrible, I dont expect this phone to last 15 months(I use phones for at least 2 years). Within the first week the screen got broken while phone was in my pocket (The crack didnt start at the edge of the screen, as a mechanical engineer I can tell you that it means that the screen's glass was damaged), this means that the water resistance was lost within the first 2 weeks of ownership. The charging plug has always been somewhat loose. I used the aux connection to connect to my antique car and listen music at the gym with Audio Technica headphones, it was terrible. I bought 3 differently branded usb C to aux adapters and the music stops randomly and makes weird noises with all of the adapters. The gps signal started alright but has progerssively gotten worse.

If Google wasn't artificially ""expiring"" my 4a 5G, I would not have even considered replacing it for a good while longer, especially with what turned out to be a lesser phone. Reviewers who gush over the Pixel ""premium' phones aren't doing users any favors.As to the external speakers, they lack almost everything from low mids down through nearly non-existent lows.

For a so-called premium Pixel phone, the sound sure isn't.  In comparison, my 4a 5G produces pretty amazing and much fuller sound, especially for a smart phone.The only reasons that I might keep this Pixel 7 are the IP68 rating, the slightly extra battery life, the slightly better camera performance, and the great deal ($475, and an $100 Amazon gift card).

The other  person could hear me clearly. After a LOT of research I found a fix that required I use developer mode.2) When listening to iHeart or YouTube there are short, intermittent audio gaps that last for about a  second.3) When I receive a notification, from Nest as an example, the audio of what I'm listening to or  watching drops by fifty-percent and requires it manually be turned up. On my Moto G5 (2022) the  audio drops for no more than a second and comes back up when I get a notification as it should.There is no excuse for Google releasing this phone with these flaws.

So, you'll be good if you live in the sunshine state.Camera bump on the back catches everything in my pocket as I put the phone in n out.  Fun, already lost a few things that way.Network connection randomly goes out and requires an airplane mode reset.  Not huge, but come on, how is this a thing after all the software work.Glass case as previously mentioned.  Who seriously cares what the phone looks like...it's not art, it's a device that has to survive daily alongside human life.Google themselves.  My calls for help on the fingerprint reader were useless and my request to warranty return it was accepted but the process requires not having a replacement phone for up to 4 weeks, so since I traded in, I'd have to buy another phone in the meantime.

"I own a pixel 5, I think it is the perfect size, I can easily use the phone one handed. I recently upgraded to a Pixel 7, but it is too big to be used one handed. Even enabling the pull down gesture to lower the screen for better one handed operation is not helpful because the touchscreen performance is so poor.The touchscreen does not seem to work on the lower third of screen. This causes a lot of frustration when trying to use the system gestures to navigate to different screens. I have to attempt to swipe several times before a gesture registers. I have tried increasing the gesture sensitivity, and enabled the screen protector sensitivity.The fingerprint reader is under the screen. I've tried multiple attempts to register a fingerprint and it just doesn't work.Overall, between the inoperable fingerprint sensor and the terrible touchscreen I would not recommend this phone.

"Let me start by saying I’ve been an avid Pixel phone user for the past a couple years. Once LG’s mobile division went under (R.I.P.) I eventually found a new home with Google’s phones. I have owned the Nexus 5, 5x, Pixel 3, 3a, 4, 4a, 5, 6a (briefly used the 6) and now the 7. Out of all those phones, there is no question that the P4 is my favorite with the 4a being a close second. So where does the new Pixel 7 rank among its peers?Easy. It’s my least favorite Pixel phone to date.FIrst and foremost, the form factor of the 4, 4a, and 5 are simply my favorite. It’s an absolute shame that out of the dozens of Android manufacturers and hundreds of models of phones, very, very few are the size of these 3 Pixels. Aside from the S22 and Zenfone 8/9, you have basically no choices these days. Even in handling the P7 after using the P4 for a while, it felt unwieldy. I kept wondering if I accidently got the P7 Pro cause it continually baffled me at how much larger it felt compared to all the comparison images and spec sheets I studied prior to purchase. But, the increased size was only augmented by…The decision to keep the nasty glass. P4 with its frosted glass (white and orange only) was the pinnacle in the series and I see why it's been implemented in so many phones. Feels excellent, looks amazing, resists fingerprints, and is easy to clean. 4a and its polycarbonate shell was almost just as good and felt/behaved very similar to frosted glass, it didn’t feel as high quality but at least was more durable. P5 feels like a damp cereal box and gives me mixed feelings, but better than normal glass. But now in late 2022 with the P7, we’re back to good ol’ reflective, scratchable, fingerprint magnet, slippery and/or tacky, glass. I have never used cases on my phones so this matters a great deal to me, but most probably wouldn’t care. Even so, the decision was still made in favor of this.The hand feel and build quality of the phone is not very good either. It’s easy to notice and feel the edges where the rails/frame meets the glass on the sides, as it rests right against your palm and fingers. The P4 (and many other phones I’ve used) do not have this problem as the sides are either a solid, uniform piece (like the 4a and 5) or its recessed far enough toward the back of the phone that it cannot be felt. Even with its predecessor the P6, the edges and hand feel were superior on that phone than they are with the P7. Not to mention, I still greatly prefer the design of the P6 with its black bar and funner color options. Holding the P7 just feels like a cheap phone. Again, if you use a case you probably won’t care.Next up we have unlocking the device. Coming from the P4, I’ve been spoiled by its magnificent face unlock. I’ve always preferred a rear fingerprint scanner, up until the P4 began converting me to its face unlock. It’s super quick, insanely consistent, and can unlock in extremely dim light. P7 has two choices of biometrics to use, face or finger, in which it does neither well especially for a 2022 phone. I can’t tell you how much of a letdown the face unlock is compared to the P4, so I abandoned it relatively quickly. Switching to the fingerprint reveals the same experience like so many have reported, it's super inconsistent. Doesn't matter how many times I re-register my prints, what angles I use, how hard I press, or in what lighting conditions I attempt in. I shouldn’t have to be fighting my phone every time I want to use it.*At this point, I want to point out that with what's been listed, the deal has been broken. I no longer care for this phone, plan on using it, want to keep it, or would reconsider it at ANY price. There is too much competition out there to have to settle for something that I don’t like.Finally, I won’t delve too much into the software bugs I encountered, as I can see these being updated and patched at some point. I think the strangest, most annoying one was trying to adjust the brightness bar, in which it instead took me into the network settings each and every time. I later read online that if you set the display size to small (I always do), the touch area for the network options will then invisibly overlap the brightness bar, rendering only a tiny portion at the bottom of the bar actually usable. Other than that, I had a few other minor glitchy behaviors such as screen seizures or freezing that was fixed with a restart. Any software issues I’ve had with the P7 have never happened on any of my other Pixel phones. Even though they’ll inevitably get patched, the user still has to deal with them for an unknown amount of time.All that being said, this is still a Pixel phone. You are going to get a class-leading camera, the soonest software updates, stock Android without bloatware, and the best Google assistant experience (if you use it). But, if you’re currently on another Pixel phone, then those advantages crumble and you must then entertain the physical discrepancies of the device to a greater degree. Thus, I’ve concluded I will be sticking with my prior Pixel phones as I do not like the P7’s size, build, feel, biometrics, or price. And for those reasons, I’m out.",My least favorite Pixel phone yet.,2.0 out of 5 stars

"It's April, I got this 6 months ago. Let me count the ways I hate it!- the fingerprint scanner NEVER works. It is total garbage. With or without a screen protector.- the facial recognition freezes up almost daily. It recognizes my face, acts like it's going to open and then nothing. I have to hit the power button to put it to sleep for a moment, press a second time, angled away from my face, swipe up and enter my passcode- when on a call, half the time I cannot also surf the internet at the same time. The entire screen goes black as though there's a loose connection somewhere. I tried to record this happening but screen recorder doesn't capture it so it's definitely the phone's display since the recorder still sees images when I don't. This only happens when on speaker phone, I tilt the phone to Google something and the screen goes black. I tilt again, and it comes back on. I try to type in a url and the screen goes off. This goes on for the entirety of a call when it happens. It's infuriating.- My phone gets hot very easily. In the past I have had a Google Pixel 2 and a Pixel 5a. Neither ever overheated this easily. About every other week this gets too warm. About once a month it shuts itself down for being too hot.- Three times now, in 6 months, my phone has locked up. Not shut off. Just locked up. Unusable brick. Once it was on a road trip and I lost all GPS!! It stays locked up anywhere from 10-30minutes. I can't even restart it. It's just frozen when this happens.- sometimes it freezes in camera mode. I can't take a pic, I can't get out of camera. It only lasts 10-30seconds but it's so frustrating!Overall, I hate it. I wish I'd kept my Pixel 5a, it was an improvement over the 7. Literally the only thing I like more about this phone is the ability to edit photos better. But an app could do that. I am likely ruined from ever buying another pixel ever again.Original Review:As a mom of many kids, not a techy. My review will not be techy at all, just my opinion and experience as a typical user.Honestly, I miss my 5A. This took about 30 minutes to set up and transfer all my apps/data (which was seamless and awesome) but it was HOT when it was done. The whole phone was hot. It will get overly warm when I use the GPS a lot, too. This worries me long term.The fingerprint scanner is almost worthless. I miss the back scanner, it always recognized my finger unless I'd just gotten out of the shower and had too much moisture on it. This in the glass scanner recognizes my fingerprint 95% of the time the first few hours after setting it and then it completely stops and recognizes it only 5% of the time thereafter. I tried deleting it and resetting it. And I had the same problem. I have a theory... as the day goes on, my fingers dry out or hydrate more depending on my surroundings and fluid intake. Could the glass fingerprint reader be so super sensitive that it cannot accommodate for those fluctuations? It's frustrating, that's for sure.The facial recognition works most of the time, unless I'm laying down or don't have my glasses on. But even when it works, I still have to touch the screen and slide up to unlock it. It's not automatically unlocked just because it sees my face. This is annoying to me.The camera is fun. There's new settings I've been playing with that I need a lot more practice with. I was able to take a neat photo of the night sky with the astrophotography mode. And some of the cinematic photos videos are neat but not perfect - for instance one of my son fishing captured my son and the fish but not the rod so it just looks weird. A lot of this is just on me needing more practice. The options are nice to have!Battery life seems good. It lasts all day and I'm a pretty heavy user between GPS, using data and taking photos. I currently don't have a TV hooked up (we moved and lost the TV power cord...ha). So I've been using my phone to watch videos and the battery life has held up.Overall, I like it. I don't love it. But I also don't like change... so I recognize that some of my issues are me and not the phone. If the fingerprint scanner worked well, and the phone never got warm, I'd be delighted with it! Instead I'm left content with it and happy with some of the new camera features.","6mo update, never buying a pixel again.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Used the phone for less than 24 hours before it stopped working. When it did work I lost service constantly then the phone suddenly could not read my sim card and I no longer had service.

"I ""upgraded"" my 4 year old pixel 3 because of battery life and the phone going out of support.  I definitely don't feel like the pixel 7 is a worthy ""upgrade"".  Yes the camera's better, but not notably for everyday use.  The new Android version is definitely an upgrade in usability.The Pixel 7 has definitely strayed into Phablet territory, which is supposed to be the Pro's usecase.  The pixel 3 was just about the perfect balance for carry-ability vs screen size.  The pixel 7 is much heavier than my old phone, and feels more like carrying a brick than a phone for both size and weight.The front fingerprint reader has about a 50% success rate (with screen protector on).  The pixel 3's reader had 80%+ success.  A lot of that has to do with angle of attack.  When I held the 3, my index finger would be flat on the reader.  With the location of the reader on the 7, my thumb is frequently at a more unpredictable angle.Audio quality is definitely a downgrade.  It's fine you're streaming audio to another output (BT headphones, casting to stereo, etc), but the onboard speakers are definitely sub-par for any audio device I've had in recent memory.

"OK, my old razor 2 phone from the 2018 or 2019 battery is getting bad.  plus, the razor doesn't have many updates.  So I decided my next phone needs to have more updates with all these malware, virus, and scam going on.  Pixel gets 5 years of updates.  Let's compare it to the old razor 2.Positives:+it is lighter+it said it has more protection features, titan 2 (whatever that is), and 5 years of updates.+better camera than the Razor.neutral:*from most basic surfing and web-browsing, simple apps, I can't tell the performance difference between this model and the razor 2 from 2018.  In most apps, I can't even tell if it is any faster, either.*Android 13 has some different features than the android 9 I had.  More on usability but not much.  maybe security stuff in the background, but not sure.*there is a camera bump out, probably to give you more focal length.*Maybe I am not used to it, but I have to swipe the finger scanner a few times or have to type my pin. The razor was easy to side-swipe.  This scanner uses the LCD screen, not a dedicated finger scanner.  I think you just push your finger and wiggle a little.  Still need to get used to it.Negatives:-the pixel 6a is a better value for the money on the black Friday sale for both.-The razor 2 phones from 2018 did 120 and 90 Hz; this model does 90hz.  only the pro can do 120hz.  Flicking the screen, I am used to the faster Hz, so sadly, the affordable pixel 6a was outclassed.  i can live with 90hz.-the screen isn't as good as the razor.  While this is longer, the razor is wider, so you see the image much better, plus a tad clear on the razor.  This has a small screen.-made mostly of plastic, the razor is metal.  I have a flip case and dropped the razor many times with no screen crack in 3-4 years.  plus a glass screen.  I am going to do the same with the Pixel 7, but I doubt it can handle a drop like the razor metal frame body.-razor had a larger speaker (yes, it was a gaming smartphone, but it is just a better component).-this gets hotter than the razor 2.  The razor 2 has a better heat sink as it was designed to game, hey, even basic processing, you feel the heat more on here, and this is a clean new install.  it is hot during idle you probably have a virus running in the background.-no charger; you have a USB-c cable with the same head. Where do you plug that into to charge?-no mini SD card, while not a big issue for some.  My razor has it.This comes with a USB-c with a matching head so you can transfer your android settings over easily.  Also included is the USB to the USB-c adapter.  Did not come with a wall plug charger at all, but I have tons of those from other devices.Honestly, I still prefer the older razor 2.  Hope they come out with another phone in the future.  The component and built quality embarrass the modern pixel 7.  We need to be able to replace our battery easier, rather buying a new phone.  But buying google will give you more updates.

"I use this about a day, comparing with my old iPhone XRPros: battery is better, a new design I like it, the camera is good(but I am not photographer), signal is little better I feel(maybe my xr is too worse)Cons: the screen is not comfortable actually comparing with my xr since it’s a OLED I guess, also it’s little dark in normal not sure if it’s a defect. Android 13 have some software issue I think. The fingerprint unlock is not good will fail sometime. The camera module is large and uncomfortable when you rotate the phone during the usageMaybe add more during the usage.Also it’s a misleading that this pixel 7 don't have a telephoto lens, so go pro if you need it.Overall, the phone is fine, not that surprising, I watch a lot video on YouTube, not sure why some people so excited about the new model.

"It is a nice phone, but doesn't feel like an upgrade from my 5a, so I returned it. Yeah it is faster, but it also runs hotter and seemed to last 1/2 as long. I get 2+ days on a charge on my 5a - the 7 only lasted 24 hrs or so. Couldn't see any difference in the photo quality. Fingerprint reader on 5a works like 90% of the time. I was getting maybe 75% of the time with the in-screen reader on the 7 and the face recognition was useless as far as I could tell. 90hz refresh doesn't do anything for me - would never notice a difference. The 7 has wireless charging, but I would never use that because I prefer a wallet case so I guess if that is important to you.

I noticed that the Pixel 7 has the same screen discoloration problem as my Pixel 4a 5G — there are rainbow tints when the screen is supposed to be white. I've learned to ignore this. The Pro version does not have this defect. The screen picks up finger smudges like crazy, but I like that the screen is flat (unlike the Pro version). As for the camera, the JPEGs are horribly overprocessed, but you can quickly edit the RAW files in Snapseed to good effect. The phone is relatively affordable, especially with a trade-in.

"I've been using this phone for about a month now. This phone feels like worse quality than my 4 year old Pixel. I bought it to upgrade to a newer model that would be in better condition with a better camera. The battery life is fine so far but (1) this did not even come with any useful charging cables. I had to order something entirely new/separate just to charge it. It came with a cable with two USBC ends and no wall block. What current wall block would have a USBC port? Why not include a cable with a USB end? I already felt like this was a red flag. (2) The phone camera really isn't any better than my old pixel which was a hand me down that I acquired in 2019. So I spent over $600 for little to no camera upgrade that didn't even include a means for charging. (3) The biometric unlock NEVER WORKS despite taking over ten finger print samples. It's infuriating. (4) No matter how many times I reset problematic apps like Google Wallet, it just automatically turns back on which frankly sketches me TF out.  There is NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF PERMANENTLY. I sell my own products using a Square reader so anytime my phone gets close to a payment system, it automatically pulls up my Google Wallet WHICH I HAVE TRIED TO TURN OFF/DISABLE MULTIPLE TIMES. I have never once actually wanted/needed to use it yet it's so sensitive that it pops up on my screen almost constantly when I'm out and about. (5) This phone is so big I can't even enter my passcode to unlock (BC the biometric login NEVER WORKS) because my thumbs aren't long enough to reach across the screen. (6) I'm also logged into Spotify and use it all the time, yet when I set my alarm to a spotify station, the alarm always defaults back to the annoying and abrasive alarm that sounds like a nuclear meltdown alarm and reads 'not logged into spotify'. Even though I open the spotify app and it it logged in. I also set my default alarm to a different sound that doesn't give me a heart attack, yet it always automatically defaults back to the alarm I don't want to be using.Don't even get my started on google photos' storage and backing up.Basically the apps are garbage on this phone and it's not even remotely an upgrade in terms of hardware. Overpriced, useless and a huge regretful purchase. What I would give to just have my old phone back.",Not at all worth it (5 major complaints),1.0 out of 5 stars
"Product became damaged - scratch you can see on a photo is from the inner side of back glass, it leaves the feeling that something has sticked out. Item was pre-ordered right after Google's presentation and i think manufacturer has produced phones in a hurry - be careful, you can receive defective product.What is more interesting - of course I have asked amazon to help with the issue, nothing moved forward. Instead of help in solving PROBLEM I was receiving unclear draft messages, there was one interesting person Sahal P. who said that he is the guy with the top position who makes decision and did not help - only solution he advised was to make a return.BTW did you know that Amazon is not covering returning fees - so guys you are just overpaying for the Item which is not damaged by your fault.  Small mathematics - Item costs 599$ to return manufacturer damaged item you need to pay at least  lets say 10$ - the send you new one or make refund of 599$ and you lose 10$ you payed for sending item back. So where is a logic? Why do I have to finance mistakes made by manufacturer or marketplace who sells defective items.Of course they said that they cannot make refund  - but I believe there is a much more ways for compensating and fixing the mistakes they made - at least make a 50% discount, give a gift card of their own marketplace with amount and guarantee for their selves returning given money as a turnover (because I can only purchase with them) and make client satisfaction on a high level, keeping client loyal - but Sahal P. is too wise for that.So now I don't know what to do - no any email for complains and as I see there is no justice at all.THINK TWICE BEFORE PURCHASING EXPENSIVE ITEMS FROM AMAZON!!!

"I purchased a Pixel 7 open box, 'like new'. Everything worked great except ability to make and received calls.  Those calls that did connect would drop audio on both ends such that it was unusable.  I worked with my service provider a multitude of times.  Including 4 working sessions with Technical support both in person and on the phone.  Ultimately the only option was to return the phone. This is where the pain begins.  If you purchase something from the warehouse (renewed) it needs to be returned to the warehouse.  There are no other options.  I was told that once they receive the phone at the warehouse it will take 1-2 weeks to get my refund. As if this was not bad enough; I had the misfortune that the UPS shipper that they selected lost the package (well they are still investigating).  When I called Amazon they said that I would need to wait 30 days from the time I shipped it for them to consider it lost and file a claim.  Further, I was told that I would need to call them back at that time (next month) to ask for a refund.Here's the thing; you can save money by buying a renewed product if you are lucky.

"This phone is not for bikers or anyone who mounts their phone for travel. the side button layout is not compatible with the majority of phone mounts used on bikes and motorcycles. If you mount the phone it will constantly press the volume button down. I suppose no one at google has ever ridden a bike or seen the sunlight. As Pixel tries to make mediocre middle of the road options to hype their pro series flagship models other companies are trying to excel their middle brand options. This pixel 7 is worst than my oneplus 8, which is a 2 year old phone. How is that possible? the screen is smaller, less resolution and the camera is actually worse in full light. I think they're dumbing down the middle road option for pixel to make their top of the line pro phone look better. Its actually an aweful marketing plan in the long run as it ruins your brand. Im still using my oneplus 8 because of the side button layout and low quality specs of the pixel. its primarily used as the kids play phone. The pixel 7 really was a let down. I dont work for any brand or agency even remotely associated with cellphones.

"The phone refused to remain connected to a cellular network. Researching the problem I found that there is a known issue that Google has acknowledged, which affects random devices across all cellular carries and affecting both physical SIM and eSIM users. There is no fix for this issue as of yet. My phone would only stay connected to cellular network for ~30sec-2min at a time, then would require either a cycling of Airplane mode, or a reboot of the phone to restore connectivity.The only resolution for this problem at this time is to get a replacement device and hope the issue is not present on that device as well. This seems to be some inherent hardware flaw on certain phones, yet Google is either unable to track this problem to a specific source, or unwilling to admit what it is.

"I had problems with this phone as soon as it was activated. The fingerprint sensor worked only intermittently so I deleted my print and tried to redo it, but everytime I tried to redo it I got a message that it timed out. I had to discontinue its use. More frustrating was the screen sensitivity. I had to tap multiple times on icons and buttons, sometimes as many as 10 times, to get them to work. I removed the screen protector to see if that was the problem, but the problem continued. Then when I tried to contact Google to start a warranty claim, their warranty claim button took me to a screen that said website not available.

"Google's advertising claims a 50MP main camera, but the phone will not produce 50 MP images. It goes through a software process called binning that results in a 12.5MP output image with no option to turn off binning or save the 50MP image. Other flagship phones also bin by default, but they have the option of saving the full resolution image from the sensor.Binning is not mentioned on the Amazon product page or on Google's own product page and when Google advertises a 50MP camera I expect it to be able to output a 50 MP image. I only noticed the reduced resolution when I was comparing pictures with my old phone and I would probably not have bought the Pixel 7 if I knew about binning before hand.

"Purchased for a family member whose device was aging and support for it was abruptly ended by LG. As I mentioned before in a past review of the Pixel 6A, if you happen to be looking for a new phone for someone in your life who you deeply care about—someone who has always bought the cheapest bargain bin phones and has lived their entire life expecting everything else to be the same—they are in for a major surprise. With minimal bloat (for now), Pixel phones are designed to be THE Android experience. With this knowledge, you can rest easy knowing that there won't be any broken software bloat that will consume all of the RAM and storage, leaving the phone virtually unusable. However, with the release of the new Pixel 7, which has the same performance (tensor) as the Pro, it is pretty much a no-brainer deal. Sure, it may not have the same camera performance, but please bear in mind that most people aren't professional photographers but rather people who just want something that works, that'll run smoothly, and that will last.Edit: Overhaul",Excellent Entry point for android,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm used to the fast delivery of Amazon Prime, and when I decided I wanted to get this phone, I ended up ordering it from Amazon to get it in a couple days instead of from the Google website which I think would have taken longer. It came in perfect shape, like it would have if I had gotten it directly from Google, completely new phone. My review here is for Amazon's fulfillment of the phone, not the Pixel itself. Though, I would also rate the Pixel 7 5 stars. Very fast phone, can hold a lot of apps, and the picture quality is amazing. (I got the 256GB just in case I wanted to record a lot of videos or something. Currently, after I had the phone for 3 weeks, with my apps and the pictures/videos I've taken, there are 44GB used. I have AT&T and already had a nano sim card in my old phone, which I just switched over to this one.)",Good place to get the phone if you have Prime,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I think this phone by far is the best bang for your buck if you are an Android user and looking for a solid experience with great price for the value this phone provides. Another great point of this phone is the fact that it comes with no unwanted app which you have to deal with when you buy a 1 plus or Samsung phone, Great experience using Google AI and vanilla. Android is the top selling points when I wanted to buy my pixel 7 and last but not least, this phone has one of the best picture quality when it comes to the camera. Also worth mention that this great experience does not need any tweaks or crazy menus to deal with, The list will go on and on but I want to stop here since I have a lot to love about this phone",It is Google,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I haven't had a Pixel for a few years, and deeply regretted switching. As an unintentional Agent of Chaos, the Pixel's Google Assistant is essential for my day-to-day. Now that I've come back to Pixel, I am ecstatic at all the improvements made. My Google Assistant answers all my phone calls, reminds me of things throughout the day, answers my questions hands-free, and I cannot even begin to describe the amazing camera/photo-editing features. And did you know it'll literally translate things for you live? There are so many features, I don't have the time or space to list them all. The only downside is that the fingerprint reader doesn't usually work, but the benefits outweigh that negative.","I missed you, Pixel",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Ordered a used Pixel 7 256 GB  in the Lemongrass color. It was delivered on time and I was able to set it up in a few minutes. I was upgrading from a Pixel 6A. It has wireless charging and a better camera. This was a fantastic upgrade for the price. Google Pixel Phones are so underrated. These phones are excellent devices and Im so happy with this upgrade. The used phone was in mint condition and even had the battery charged to 100%. If you haven't tried a Google Pixel Phone, you owe it to yourself to give one a test drive. This was a fantastic deal.",Pixel 7 256 GB - Great buy  on used Pixel 7,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought this for my father to replace an aging Samsung Galaxy S9, and I am extremely happy with my purchase. The phone is incredibly fast, and the 5G connectivity provides lightning-fast internet speeds. The camera is simply amazing, and it takes stunning photos in any lighting condition.The phone's design is sleek and modern. The battery life is impressive, and I can easily go a full day without needing to recharge.Overall, I highly recommend the Google Pixel 7-5G Android Phone to anyone looking for a fast, reliable, and feature-packed Android smartphone. It is a better experience than many of the alternatives!","Phenomenal battery, camera and experience",5.0 out of 5 stars
"To be fair i havent gotten a new phone since 2019 and it was locked ad android 9 i believe. The difference between that one and the pixel 7 running on android 13 is insane. The battery life is the biggest perk. The camera is probably better than my old sony shooter if im being honest. The photo editor where you can remove unwanted photobombers is also pretty cool, hit n miss on whether or not it looks believable, but you really should try to make your pictures as naturally blemish free as possible if that really matters to you. I dont use the fingerprint feature so i cant comment on it, but there is a setting called screen protector mode that makes the touch more sensitive for people who were apparently having troubles with the fingerprint not working with a screen protector on. Over all very pleased with the pixel 7.",Wonderful phone!,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm glad Google was able to keep the price for the 7 at $599, it really hits that sweet spot of performance and price. Upgraded from an older Sony phone and holy cow was this a step up. Love that it gets at least 5 years of security updates, wish it was more for sustainability reasons but 5 is better than two.Build quality is premium, the phone is snappy, and I've noticed an immediate improvement in my call quality (both from and to me). The camera is surpurb and allows me to take great photos of my dog without hauling my DSLR around. Does it replace a dedicated full frame or apsc camera? No. Does it take photos almost as good for social media and fits in my pocket? Heck yes it does. Well done Google, I'm very happy with this phone","Great package, great value",5.0 out of 5 stars
I preorder this phone on announcement day from Amazon with the $100 gift card. I am very happy that I went with this option and not from other retailers because I received the phone ontime and did not have a problem receiving the $100 promotional discount. The phone itself is working flawlessly except for two minor annoyances. The fingerprint sensor is not reliable but I had expected this since I have a screen protector. The tap action is also not reliable. I had a Spigen clear case that made the back too thick and phone too bulky to tap. I changed to an aramid fiber case that is very slim and allows me to tap in the camera bar comfortablely but flashlight don't turn on and off everytime. The Motorola chop action or the OnePlus draw on screen are more reliable.,Delightful phone,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I am not a phone ""geek"" so I cannot rate all the many options and customizations available. I spent several hours on YouTube videos learning about the things I wanted to customize... Am super happy with everything  except for the following caveats.  1 - I do not use fingerprint scanner, so no feedback on that. 2 - Was annoying to me that Google forces an upper-left hand date and a google search bar at bottom of home screen. These two things cut down on useable screen area that I have always used on prior phones, and I do not use the search bar. I installed the Nova launcher to solve those issues, BUT Google does not provide an API for other launchers to utilize the Pixel 7 gestures... My workarounds satisfied me, but others should understand  and research per their own desires/needs.","Really nice phone, but needed to use a 3rd party launcher for my needs.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Fingerprint is hit or miss... Works better when your fingers are not dry. Been using the phone for key a week and works great for day to day use... Not using for gaming or streaming. Doesn't get hot while in use or charging (using with a case). Battery lasts me all day. I don't regret not getting the pro version, smaller footprint than the pro so it fits better in my hand and saved me $250 (this was $485 on sale vs the 7pro which was $735 on sale).One thing to mention is that there have been reports of the camera glass shattering without impact/falling (could be due to change in temperature going from room temp to cold temperatures outside)","Good phone, great camera.",5.0 out of 5 stars
My mother wanted a new phone to replace her still perfect Huawei mate 9 (just for a change) and after much research I ordered this one. Hoping that it’s easy to use and doesn’t give her problems for a couple more years. Glad I did. She’s happy with it and it was super easy to set up. It did get hot when I connected to transfer information but hasn’t been hot again. Maybe that’s what people were complaining about. The lemongrass color is beautiful. Everything works fast and smooth and battery lasts a long time. I decided on the 7 pro after seeing how nice this one is but have to wait a long time to receive that one.,Smooth,5.0 out of 5 stars
"To be fair, I am a Pixel fan since Pixel 3. However, I was bit disappointed after Pixel 4,5 and 6. However, everything with Pixel 7 looked perfect for me and so I upgraded from Pixel 3 to Pixel 7 and its been an amazing experience.I dont know why people are crying about fingerprint reader, but it works perfectly for me. No issues with battery either. It just works perfectly without any performance issues. So I loved it.Best thing about Pixel 7 is its Photos and Videos. It takes supreme low light photos as well. I just loved every bit of it till now. I have been using it for almost 2months now.",Super phone at super price,5.0 out of 5 stars
This phone does everything I need it to do. I like the fact it will have OS updates for 3 years. This is an afterthought for my previous phones. The battery seems to hold up for most of the day and can be stretched by using the battery saver. It charges quickly with my OnePlus charger.I really enjoy using the camera. It has everything I want and more. Magic Eraser is amazing. Good enhancements for different scenarios. I like the video stabilizer.The fingerprint reader is hit or miss. If you use fingerprint for access to secured apps make sure to use a password easy to recall. Face recognition works very well even with dim light.,"Feature packed, great choice for the money.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Every phone I have ever had I've hated something about it, until my Pixel 7, its the best phone I've bought, I will definitely be going Pixel from here on out. Great photo quality, battery life is really good, screen is good, runs nice and smooth, finger print sensor could be a bit better, and most of the time the Bluetooth don't auto connect, but over all I love this phone. I've had cheaper budget phones last me 2-2 1/2 years hopefully I can make this last the same or more.","Great phone, definitely recommend!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Upgrading to Pixel 7 + Android 13 met all my expectations in a smartphone.Great (Black Friday discount) price.Transferring my carrier's physical SIM, all my data, all apps and, all app settings (using the provided usb-c to usb-c cable) from my 3-year-old Pixel-3a (Android 12) to this new pixel 7 was very smooth and seamless.Pros: Over the top display, speed, refresh speed, battery life, battery charge time, audio, camera photos and videos.Conn:  google did not include a phone charger with the pixel 7 (needs to buy separately for $25).I am not a fan of, do not (and will) intend to use the so called fingerprint reader nor face features so I decline to review those.",Best smartphone experience  with Pixel 7 + Android 13,5.0 out of 5 stars
"PROS:I use the camera to take photos for my website. They are excellent quality and easy to focus.In 3 months, I haven't had a single glitch or crashed app. Definitely a well managed android build.Good overall integration between apps and OS. Very seamless.CONS:Battery life on par with my (4 year old!) pixel 3a. The pixel 3a when NEW had much better battery life.The camera has a very shallow sensor, so when taking close up photos of a small object, the edges are always blurred. Sometimes this is a very good thing. Sometimes it's not.","Great photos, weak battery, snappy OS, zero bugs",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Coming from Pixel line 4, 4A, 6 & 6A. The last daily device I've used was the Pixel 6. I really liked the design and the features but the biggest cons I have for it was the fingerprint scanner and the network connectivity issue. The Pixel 7 is not really that much of an upgrade but they did fixed the network connectivity issue and somewhat improved the fingerprint scanner. Although it's still a hit or miss but they've added the face recognition so that helps. Also the new Tensor 2 did bring improvements but not a big margin in real life usage.",Somewhat worth the upgrade,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I use my phone mostly to make calls, a little browsing and taking pictures so I really don't need the newest phone every year. Actually, my Pixel 3 that this one is replacing works just fine, but I wanted to feel safe by knowing I am getting regular software updates.I can't really say much more than other online reviews already state, the camera is fantastic, the screen nice and bright and crisp and the battery lasts for about a day or so.Works for me.",It can't get much better than this!,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The battery is not the greatest. It's about the same as my old phone which was two years old. It does charge faster though which is nice. It was a little disappointing this didn't come with a wall plug. Thankfully my old charger is compatible and it didn't matter too much.The camera is amazing! Because the camera takes such detailed pictures, they are usually large files and will take up space quickly. It was really disappointing there is no space for an SD card.Apps that were really slow on my old phone are insanely fast now. The tensor chip really makes a difference in quick and smooth functionality.","Great camera, okay battery, no SD card slot",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The device performs as expected. It is fast responsive and just amazing. The camera Takes great photos too! Coming from iPhone, I cant complain.

"Recently had an iphone 13 mini, then went to Samsung S22 - both ok battery life unless I was traveling and then they were HORRIBLE. The Pixel 7 ends the day (~14 hours of on and off usage) with ~70% battery life left and travels much better than the others. The user interface is ""cleaner"" / simpler than the Samsung Android interface too. I'm very happy to finally have a phone that doesn't give me fits.",GREAT battery life and intuitive interface,5.0 out of 5 stars
I love the speed of this phone and the software is pretty cool. It lasts me about 2 days with regular usage (your mileage may very). Gaming and heavy usage will kill the battery quickly though.Facial recognition only works in decent lighting but work well in those condition.

"I have uploaded video of screen picture quality and Night photo which I took at 3 AM. Pretty impressed. Below is the detailed review.Pros:Powerful Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processorLong-lasting battery with 100W fast chargingBeautiful 6.7-inch AMOLED curved display with 120Hz refresh rateClean and simple softwareCompetitive priceGood for gamingCons:No expandable storageNo headphone jackCamera could be betterI have observed slow finger print response.Overall, the OnePlus 11R is a great phone for those who are looking for a powerful and affordable device. It has a great processor, a long-lasting battery, and a beautiful display. The software is also very clean and simple to use. However, the camera could be better, and there is no expandable storage or headphone jack.Here is a more detailed look at the pros and cons of the OnePlus 11R:Pros:1) Powerful Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor: The OnePlus 11R is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor, which is one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market. This means that the phone is incredibly fast and can handle even the most demanding tasks with ease.2) I have played  games like Genshin Impact, PUBG, Call of Duty and Asphalt games runs really smooth.3) Long-lasting battery with 100 W fast charging: The OnePlus 11R has a large 5000mAh battery, which is more than enough to power the phone for a full day on a single charge. The phone also supports 100 W fast charging, which means that you can quickly top up the battery when you need to.4) I am fan of  curved screen it gives you premium look. I haven't seen any accidental touches from my side. The OnePlus 11R has a beautiful 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. This means that the display is incredibly smooth and responsive, and it's perfect for gaming or watching videos.4) Clean and simple software: The OnePlus 11R runs OxygenOS, which is one of the cleanest and simplest Android skins on the market. The software is very easy to use, and it doesn't come with any bloatware.Cons:1) Battery drain fast. I have observed battery drain issue. I usually keep phone Wi-Fi on when I go to sleep within 3 to 4 hours it drains 10% to 15% of battery which is not good.2) While I have seen Lag sometimes but gaming gives you smooth experience.3) The OnePlus 11R has a triple-lens rear camera system, but the camera performance is not as good as some of the other phones in this price range. The main camera is good, but the ultrawide and macro cameras are not as good.Overall, the OnePlus 11R is a great phone for those who are looking for a powerful and affordable device. It has a great processor, a long-lasting battery, and a beautiful display. The software is also very clean and simple to use. However, the camera could be better.",Value for Money,4.0 out of 5 stars

You will get premium look, good performance, excellent display, excellent speaker output, very good camera and afterall a great software experience. I think this is balanced smartphone under 45k.

"Ok this review might be a bit long , but then this might help a few in opting for a better decision.First of all there are a lot of positive as well as negative feedback on this particular device OnePlus 11r . ( Very subjective )After almost 6 months from its debut , I was trying to get the latest updates on two phones before buying .The nothing phone 2 or OnePlus 11r.Being a stock Android user for the past 15 years , I lost my complete hope on OnePlus giving up with the oxygen OS being stock to a slightly mixed up Colour OS ( since oppo took in ) .Which made me hold on for a little while till Nothing launched there phone 2 .I was very sceptical at first , and then decided to do a hands on and compare these two side by side in the local second hand market .After spending almost a fair amount of time with both the phones together.I came to a very promising and a surprising conclusion to buy the ONEPLUS 11R .REASON BEING - OnePlus has the same chip ( SD 8+gen1 ) might even be better ( I got an antutu score 1.32mn.The cameras ( main sensor ) Sony imx 890 , performing absolutely spectacular after the July update , better than nothing phone 2 with good dynamic range .Ultrawide being good but not great .Then comes the OS , this was the shocking part . It's as fluid as before ( Nothing more to say ) . The chip was performing with very minimal heat signs and blazing fast gaming with 90fps on both BGMI & COD .Well the build , cellular reception , call quality , mic , stereo speaker , display ( 1.5k 120hz ) , & a 100w supervooc charger in the box were all tad bit more than nothing phone 2.So the only thing remaining was the green line issue , and after OnePlus announcing a lifetime free replacement for any issue on the display made me place the order .Damn the phone is amazing 😍😍😍🤩 in hand .OnePlus now has promised a 4 year update and. 5 year security patch .Which Gave me a strong feeling on the VFM I hold right now .So yeah , for 40k this is a very good performance and a premium phone .I would 100% recommend it till date as the best Smartphone for anyone to buy it .One thing aside I also got a free 6 months extended warranty from the Red cable club.Now after using it for the past one month with the SOT ( ALMOST 8HRS ) .What else do we really want 🤔🤔.I would rate a solid 9/10 .OnePlus really killed it this time a 💯%>.Happy buying folks .",11r is The best 2023 All-rounder.

"I was using Iphone 12 previously. I had no issues with it though I needed a new phone. Ios feels ok but there is so much less in features and app support compared to the Android. Out of all I chose this phone and I am glad.Honest comparison from ios user,I just love stock UI❤️,clean that's it. No bloatwares and snappy experience.Looks of the phone are good , the black one looks pretty classic and stealthy. Glass body is easy to clean though catches more dust and debree than an Iphone. Though it is definitely a head turner. Dimensions are ok to hold with one hand too. Display is crisp, haven't noticed any difference in viewing quality.Processor is on the tops. Not to ignore 8gen 1 is itself a pretty power hungry chip so people complaining of low battery life. It is how it is. Talking about battery drain. I noticed standy drains more than when you're using scrolling though feeds , watching videos. Lasts like a whole day and Im still left with 30 plus on the device.Charging speeds have blown my mind🤯. 32 watt on IP12 is good but 100watts damn , 20 mins full charged.Camera!This is my honest review.  It does have a punch. Portraits can somewhat beat the iphones  or just color saturation is a bit more as iphone gives natural photos and different processing here. AI is pretty good for camera post processing though the video stabilization could have been better.Ultra wide lens and depth control are powerful enough, pictures do have a volume in it and can give somewhat appreciable and posts (tweets/pics) professional clicks if handled right. I have not got a chance to click much but I believe.Ps : pictures taken from iphone looks way much better on this device. More realistic, more accurate. I think this is vice versa picture looks great even on iphone clicked with OnePlus .Won't let you down 8 out of 10 times for sure. I loved it to be honest.Powerful, handy, device with zero to none laga or stuck. This is definitely one of the best phone as of now in the price point.Oneplus Yes!",Lovely!,4.0 out of 5 stars

"I WAS A BIT CONFUSED WHETHER I SHOULD BUT S21FE OR 11R FOR MY FATHER DURING GREAT INDIAN FESTIVAL ... HE WAS USING SAMSUNG J7 PRIME FOR PAST 7 YEARS , I WAS SO MUCH CONFUSED BETWEEN BOTH PHONES SO I ORDERED BOTH OF THEM , 11R 256GB AT 38K AND S21 FE 256GB AT 31K ...... WE TESTED BOTH PHONE FOR 1 WEEK AND  I GOT THE CONCLUSION , IF YOUR REQUIREMENTS ARE BATTERY , MULTIMEDIA , GOOD AND FAST SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE AND WANT TO USE PHONE FOR LONGER PERIOD OF TIME SIMPLY GO WITH ONE PLUS 11R , BUT IF YOUR PRIORITY IS CAMERA AND YOU CAN COMPROMISE WITH BATTERY , YOU CAN CHARGE YOUR PHONE TWICE A DAY THEN GO WITH S21 FE ... AND 1 THING ALSO S21 FE HAS MORE SOFTWARE UPDATES AS COMPARED TO 11R BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN S21FE WILL LAST MORE , BECUASE ALREADY  IS HAD HEATING AND BATTERY ISSUE WHICH WILL INCREASE WITH TIME , AND AFTER 3 YEARS YOU HAVE TO SWITCH TO A NEW PHONE IF YOU PURCHASE S21FE ... ON OTHER SIDE 11R BATTERY BACKUP IS AWESOME AND IT HAS 16GB RAM SO THERE IS NO LAG ISSUE , UI IS CLEAN AND IT IS MUCH BETTER FOR GAMING ALSO .... MY RECOMMENDATION IF YOU ARE ALSO CONFUSED BETWEEN THESE PHONES OR ANY OTHER PHONE AT THIS PRICE RANG 30K-40K THEN YOU SHOULD DEFINETLY GO WITH ONEPLUS 11R , IT IS BETTER THEN EVERY PHONE IN THIS RANGE WHETHER IT IS S21FE , NOTHING PHONE2 ORR IQUE .... 11R IS JUST BETTER ONLY 1 DRAWBACK IS ITS CAMERA , WHICH IS NOT SO MUCH WORSE BUT IT CAN BE IMPROVED WHILE CLICKING PHOTOS IT SHOWS VERY CLEAR PHOTO BUT AFTER PROCESSING IT ADDS A LITTLE BIT OF SHARPNESS ESPECIALLY IN VIDEOS IT DO NOT LOOK GOOD",FAR BETTER THEN S21FE,4.0 out of 5 stars

"The camera, performance, software glitches etc. so I bought this phone was my father and he is not as technical as me. Although I can handle software glitch and performance issue but as a normal consumer, it is a hassle. OnePlus needs to work on optimization of their products. The camera, it messes up faces and creates white flash on skin which basically destroy the pictures. This is my initial impression and I hope they update it through software. Besides this, the product is decent and charging speed is an overkill. The design is great too although we prefer a flat display than curved cuz it's hard to find tempered glass. My review in short: Good hardware but can do better especially with software updates.",The phone have issues,3.0 out of 5 stars

"Brought in the Amazon Great Indian Festival, 2023. Value for money, so far haven't faced any issues.Frankly it is better than I thought, most people say camera isn't that great, but personally, Camera is decent, video recording is good as well.It can handle Gaming, I did play COD, and It was great even in highest graphics, GTA San Andreas lags abit in highest resolution.Battery is greatest advantage. without any heavy usage like gaming, can last from morning till evening.It charges from 0 to 100 in about 35 mins. I keep it on charge for further 20 mins once a week.Haven't got annoyed or felt disappointing  with phone.I do recommend getting this phone if budget is under 40k.",Value for money.,5.0 out of 5 stars

"After having OnePlus 1 original, OnePlus 3T, OnePlus 5T and OnePlus 7T, I never thought I'll get another OnePlus. Let's be honest, OnePlus 6T was the last best camera phone, and OnePlus 7T was the last overall great phone at that time.But suddenly again I got interested in 11. But the budget is just too extreme. So thought as usual maybe will give 11R a try. Already knew the issues with 11 were not in 11R.So bought it. Made a mistake last time getting 8GB, so went for 16GB. Got a blazing fast phone, with a few issues -1. The 100W charger heats up the phone like a toaster. I'm so using the old 7T charger for this phone.2. Weird sounds in WhatsApp. The mic noise cancellation doesn't work well in speakerMode.3. Camera color reproduction is a concern, but overall I love the camera.4. Hate the carved screen, I mean I literally hate it. It makes the side of the phone weird way or colours while watching content. Not to mention the occasional slip in the games. But you get used to it. The color on the screen are great though.5. Still can't find a proper screen guard since all of them have to be with UV glue, which no wonder is not good for your phone. Specially if you're using the 100W charger.But all of the cons are overshadowed by the fact that this phone is durable. Had to travel in a upper birth in train, and my phone feel flat to the ground from that height. I'm not joking, not a single scratch. The phone fell even camera side down. Agreed the spigen cover saved it a bit, but from that height, it was wow.I've decided to leave a 5 star since this device deserves it.",For 40K I would want a fast and durable device - This is it,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Bought the 16/256 GB OP11R variant in the GIF Sale. Phone is a complete package with a few nitpicking cons. First is the software experience which has been ruined by the integration of ColorOS with OnePlus's signature OxygenOS which makes it look like some cheap realme/Oppo phone. Encountered some bugs here and there in the UI (Hoping for fixes with timely updates as promised). The second downside of this phone I faced is the inconsistent battery life. I have been using the phone with the maximum refresh rate which is 120hz from day 1. Faced quick battery drains many times even with casual usage but these are inconsistent, as sometimes I get around a good 7-8 hours of SOT with same refresh rate and usage. So here I felt as if the battery performance is very irrational and depends on various usage scenarios.Apart from these issues, the phone is a complete package and a value for money deal for the ones who are looking for a good Android phone with flagship specifications. Thanks.",A Good Phone with poor software experience and battery life,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I am using oneplus phone from almost 6 years, my last phone was Oneplus 5.Pros -Good UI as alwaysNo bloatwareCharging speed is greatGood 5g reception on both simsWifi works flawlessNo lag so farGives out a full day batteryCons -I am not sure whether it is camera or the camera optimisation, this phone doesn't gives out the best. Primary rear camera is of some use, other 2 are gimmicky and of no use.The color production and image processing has deteriorated with time. If you take a portrait shot, there is a extra lighting added on the edges of person body, the natural tone is long gone with 0 beautification. You need to relay on post-processing.I am not a photo enthusiast but like to capture good moments. Videos are very average, you can easily compare them with any 20k phone camera. OIS works fine.

"Let me make this simple for you, like a everyday user would like to hear.Pros:1. Amazing Performance - blazing fast 120hz, and high end processor, screen is extremely responsive and you will love playing games etc. ZERO LAGS2. Great Screen - in this price range One plus offers the best screen much like Samsung or Apple. Even better than those. Perfect to read an ebook. Curved edges make it even better.3. Strong design - I have dropped this phone like 10 times and max drop is 6 feet. Nothing happened. Not a scratch.4. Placement of buttons is another plus. Fingerprint reader is best placed and u can easily navigate.5. Glassy finish at the back, makes it look very premium.6. Fastest charging! Literally 10 minutes from 20% to 100%. Superfast indeed!Cons :1. Camera - sucks big time. If you are a photography enthusiast you'd dislike it immediately. The color reproduction is like one plus nord. I still loved the colors when one plus 6T was launched. Post that it has gone worse. The portrait mode is still better on this phone I'd say, rest if u use 0.6x you'll see that the objects get less sharp. In daylight or room light the camera would be fine, just FINE. Nothing extraordinary. Night camera processing still needs development.2. Whatsapp video calls have background noise. Very terrible. I hope it will get resolved after a few updates. Calling quality is generally bad.3. It is not Waterproof.4. You need to operate the phone with 2 hands at all times. It is pretty heavy.Conclusion : If u are a performance user, you'll love this. For daily work, like social media, emails, gaming or streaming live videos, perfect Phone, no issues at all. Brilliant battery life and charging. Easily 15-18 hours screen time.If you love camera and want to record ground breaking content, this is NOT a good choice.Overall, buy it to replace a phone with exchange. For a new phone, don't go for this.",Perfect Phone but the Camera.....,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Switching from an 7 years iPhone experience to an Android was a gamble to me and the gamble doesn't paid off,processor is good and it won't bother in terms of speed though its not a pure gaming phoneCurve in the 120hz display is an addition but you'll not feel a premium experience as I had my relame 10 pro plus with better display and overall display experience ( though it was stolen in a week of purchase), the side edges showing a dark boundary sort of stuff ( more than what I felt in realme 10 pro plus (priced at 25k)Battery is good ( not outstanding) but the 100 watt charging handle the department well.Camera is the main disappointement for me, not expected this from OnePlus , please atleast provide a decent camera it ruins the brand value , nothing better than these oppo Vivo brand camera, specially the front camera  making the camera department much more disappointing.One last flaw I felt I was ( might be subjective ) the sound output test from the earbuds ( both available OnePlus Nord buds and the buds z2 ) is not upto the mark even with the provided Dolby Atmos and the spatial audio feature, the sound output I was getting in my iphone 12 mini was way better even without this OnePlus phone earphone with the same two oneplus earbuds I have.Conclusion- if you are an apple user , don't buy this phone ,Existing Android users can buy this if they want to have a phone with a better processor and battery department WITH THE A REPUTATION OF ONEPLUS BRAND",Not recommended for an apple user to switch,3.0 out of 5 stars

"The OnePlus 11R is a sleekly designed smartphone with a premium feel and solid build quality. Its AMOLED display impresses with vibrant colors and a 120Hz refresh rate, offering smooth and captivating visuals. Powered by a Snapdragon processor and ample RAM, the phone delivers snappy performance for daily tasks and gaming. However, its camera setup, while decent, struggles in low-light conditions.Battery life is satisfactory, lasting a full day with moderate to heavy usage, and the fast charging feature is a convenient addition. OxygenOS provides a clean interface with useful customizations, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. The phone offers reliable connectivity options, including 5G support.Its mid-range price, the OnePlus 11R offers commendable value for its features, including its display quality, performance, and design.

"It's been around 2months since I'm using it.Camera quality is really good it could have been better. Sometimes the edge detection isn't very good and quality is inconsistent (not often). But the video quality is better competitive to photo. Overall a good camera quality (not a camera centric phone remember).The battery backup is best for minimal use (almost 8hr) charging speed is quite fast ( takes 25mins to charge fully 20-100).Animation of apps opening close is very smooth and fast(no complain).Phone gets slightly warmer ( not to warry ). When high refresh rate is in use like gaming and even in doulingo (if used for hours continuously).I would say a good phone in 40k range. No ads,  clean experience. If it had IP rating and telephoto lence it would be very amazing.",Phone review,4.0 out of 5 stars
"This review is made after 14 days of use.Pros :Amazing design, makes you just want to look at your phone and also gets you attention.Display, you get the flagship level experience.Performance, things are smooth and fast. Won't disappoint you.Battery, will run 1 full day on moderate use. Got 6-7hrs screen on time. With a lil bit of gaming it can be 5-6hrs. But you can charge it in 20-30 minutes so you can't ask any better.Cons :This is a major issue, the camera is good but not great. I mean of course you cannot get the iPhone kinda pictures but they could remove the useless macro and low quality ultra wide and just give single good camera, I would still buy the phone.Front camera is as same as the Nord phones. So yes, camera is a 8/10And the main issue I have with the phone is the bugs. This phone comes with a lot of bugs. I guess every OnePlus phone comes with unique bugs that it's really hard to explain to someone. Sometimes the lockscreen only shows wallpaper, some apps won't work like how it should and a weird crackling noise along with notification sound. These doesn't happen always but you don't want to have such experience.This phone doesn't have gorilla glass and IP rating.Yes I bought this phone after knowing these two protection doesn't exist in this phone and it's all about how we take care. But there are some phones in market under 30k that has these two protections. And even wireless charging. I mean you pay 40k and you don't get water resistant or a better glass? A lil disappointing.So this is my review after 14 days. If there was no weird bugs and if the camera was great and some protection, this phone will be perfect.And if you are someone who is looking for a phone which can be good in every aspects then this phone is worth going for. Basically an all rounder.So yeah, this phone is a 8/10",Great phone but not perfect,4.0 out of 5 stars

Purchased this phone 6 months back so thought of reviewing this product.I bought this phone with lots of high hopes but atlast I was disappointed.The most prime demerit of this phone is it's battery backup I have to charge  my phone 2 times or sometimes 3 times a day.Even when I am not using the phone the battery drains down swiftly.Camera quality at this range is not upto the mark.I am extremely dissatisfied with this product will suggest everyone to think twice before buying.,One plus 11r review after 6 months of usage.,1.0 out of 5 stars

They told there is a fungus formation due to water exposure.I was shocked since  there were no instances where my phone got exposed to water.They sent us this image but it was not 100% conclusive and the technicians also admitted that if there was water exposure there would be fog in the camera lenses and would be bulged.They also told this won't be covered under warranty and thus we need to pay 2202 rupees.I was not satisfied since fungus forming in the battery is a new thing and it was not 100% conclusive.I hope it reaches one plus officials and necessary action is taken regarding this.",Fraud OnePlus service centre,1.0 out of 5 stars

As long as your device is fine and you don't ever run into problems then buying oneplus is a good idea otherwise pray that you don't have to visit the customer service center ever.Everyday there's a queue from 10am and the service center operates between 11:00am to 7:30pm. Waiting time is more than an hour and the facility has only 3 counters for processing requests.I don't know if my next phone would be a OnePlus phone if the same continues even though India is one of its largest consumer.,Stay away.

"This is my review after being a user of Xiaomi devices for the past 6-7years.Pros:- Display and speaker sound level.Cons:- 1)comparitively I felt the options in miui to be much easy to use and find(very hard to find features and options through search).2)No Dolby sound on speakers(only on earphones).3) Absolutely pathetic Ram management,system UI and Android consumes around 3-4 GB of RAM.4)After long usage,apps are getting struck and slow(never expected this on a snapdragon 8 gen+1 processor).5)In my Mi11x which is almost half the price and two years old there were no issues and absolutely incredible.6) battery discharge is very abnormal sometimes it discharges quickly and sometimes it's good.7) Screen touch at times and at certain angles is not as smooth.8)Mobile is getting hot even without Playing games(probably due to worst RAM management,only around 2gb of Ram is available almost at all times).9) Fingerprint sensor does not appear on screen sometimes.Not sure what is wrong.Will definitely go back to Mi phones soon, looking at the one week OnePlus performance.",Observation after shifting from Mi11x to OnePlus 11 R,2.0 out of 5 stars

How dumb instead of providing soft button.3.Auto suggest Password window hanging unable to enter text.4. All apps don't close when u close it says system optimised n stays..5.

They said I should get this  fixed in nearby OnePlus store.When I went to OnePlus store they said people are using tampered glass the liquid is creating this issue.When I told I never installed any tampered glass.They didn't had any answer. Now they said we already have 100's of same issue registered. We will place the order for your new power button chip once it is available will give you call.Its been 2 months now didn't hear anything back.So anyone has any doubt please check on nearby OnePlus store the similar issues registered.,DO NOT BUY THIS PHOTO,2.0 out of 5 stars

"I ahve been using ONEPLUS 11R since 1 months. I think I am more than quqlify to write a honest review. First, Let me write about the seller.I  had a  vert disappointing experience with this  seller who advertised same-day delivery for their products, but failed to deliver on their promise. After placing my order, I was shocked to find out that the delivery would not be completed until 13 days later.This kind of misrepresentation is unacceptable and has caused a great deal of inconvenience and frustration for me. It is clear that the seller did not take their advertised delivery times seriously and failed to deliver on their promises.As a result of this experience, I cannot recommend this seller to anyone looking for reliable and honest service. It is crucial for sellers to be transparent and honest about their delivery times in order to maintain the trust and credibility of their customers.In conclusion, if you are considering ordering from this seller, I would advise you to proceed with caution and be prepared for possible delays and disappointment.Let me write a honest review.The battery life is disappointing. Even with moderate usage, the battery drains quickly and needs to be charged frequently. This can be a major inconvenience for anyone who relies on their phone for work or personal use. The build quality is not as good as previous models. The phone feels flimsy and fragile, and the back cover scratches easily. The fingerprint sensor is also unreliable and often fails to recognize my fingerprint.The price of the ONEPLUS 11R is not justified considering the subpar features and performance. There are many other smartphones in the market with similar or better features that are available at a lower price point.In addition to the aforementioned issues, I also faced software problems with the ONEPLUS 11R. The phone frequently froze or crashed, and some apps would not function properly. The user interface was also confusing and difficult to navigate, making it frustrating to use the phone.I tried resetting the phone and updating the software, but the issues persisted. This made me lose faith in the reliability and functionality of the device, and I ultimately regretted my purchase.Considering the camera quality, battery life, build quality, and software issues, I would strongly advise against purchasing the ONEPLUS 11R. It simply does not live up to the standards that you would expect from a high-end smartphone.Overall, I would not recommend the ONEPLUS 11R 5G to anyone looking for a reliable smartphone with good features. There are better options available in the market that offer better value for money.",Disappointed from ONEPLUS Team,2.0 out of 5 stars

"11r 16/256. I have observed a lot of lag in some applications mostly in youtube. While watching short videos most of the time it starts playing next video without completing the current one but the video description does not change, its very annoying. Heavy application like outlook (my office mailbox) loads very slow and sometimes stops responsing. Not able use some banking apps. They do not open at al. I tried uninstalling and installing again still does not work. Haptic feedback also I dont like. Regret buying this above moto edge 40. I used my friend's edge 40 for sometime which is far more smooth than 11r. No 120 hertz in youtube and chrome and in many other apps. Processor is underclocked, does not feel like SD 8+gen1.

The review is from person who is using IPhone 14. The product is fine and does the job. What I don’t like at all is for all software’s install you have to agree of T&C.

Some months later, got some camera specific updates, looked like performance had improved...later there were more updates...which again ruined camera performance. 3 stars all coz of camera2. Performance: fingerprint sensor becomes defunct...if you have a fingerprint enabled app in the background...donno is it with my device or in general3.

"I am using OnePlus since 6 series and now 11r series. Price of ₹40000 is nothing for Oneplus series. Recently they also launched budget Nord series. User of OnePlus knows how smoothly software and hardware work in oneplus but this time I am very much disappointed with the short tenure ( 15-30 seconds) hanging of the phone in every 3-4 hrs without any heavy work. Immediate software update is highly recommended.Front camera should be replaced(beyond software update) by OnePlus because video calls will show you like ghost to opposite side. Back camera is very very ordinary.Rubbish photos, hanging characters makes this phone an avoidable one in such price range.

"Im the Saddest customer using your Amazon services. I recently purchased a ""One + 11r"" Mobile from Amazon. I was getting a great deal waiting all night for offers and Promo codes. I was happy at the time of purchase.  and let me explain the fault that I was suffering:*Total Phone cost:  39999rs*Exchange of old Phone: -9950rs.*No-cost EMI discount:  -2305rs.(SBI card interest discount)  Order Total:  27743 ( I paid with Credit card)*As Above mentioned were all the costs for your Note. here I request all that At the time of delivery only. The charger wire was broken, and from the second day, I'm getting Screen ( Display). Problem I've personally shared the Pic and the Customer Service team has escalated my issue and forwarded it to the next level of Management from Amazon. and they have Diagnosed the screen and requested I raise a ticket for return pickup. and assured me I'll get entirely Paid and exchanged value for My old Phone which is 9950rs. In my Amazon Pay wallet. even I said Please give me a replacement but they said Once the order is picked only. Then they have access to the refund or replacement.*My Request is only for Replacement but they have credited 6950, Instead of 9950. I've completely got a loss of 3000rs. Im asking at least to consider my problem as a high priority because within 24hrs I got multiple problems with Mobile (One + 11r).*While Speaking with Customer Service they said I'll get 9950rs on Amazon that's the reason I accepted for refund.*I request the Amazon Team pls check the Customer service team Messages in my inbox gave me a false.*Please Amazon. I will purchase a new Mobile from your Site. Kindly refund me my Actual value of 9950.",Product worst quality.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"The screen of this phone is so bad that it could not endure a scratch from a metal button inside my pocket which my previous phone worth 15k endured for 3 years... Also there are many glitches which just shake my mind.. for example the game bar doesn't appear half of the time, the auto rotate in this phone is a mess; it is making me play a landscape game (shadow fight 4, T3 etc) in portrait mode which is making me furious.. wasted my 4 hours to look how to solve this issue but couldn't help (the problem is that the locked orientation in the game bar was turned on accidentally and now the game bar is not appearing back). Also if 120 Hertz refresh rate is on the battery dies within 5 hours, like there is no adaptive refresh rate controller. Also the positioning of buttons is very Messy, whenever I try to turn off my phone by pressing the power key the volume down button key also get pressed and it takes a screenshot.. also less customisation options are there in the settings menu for shortcuts and gestures. The flashlight is so dim that it's better off than on....Editing this review after 2 months of usage. Please please don't buy this scrap.. Total waste of money... Rather go for some mi phone.

On the other hand i received a call from oneplus and they said visit a service store for fault confirmation that too i have done. But oneplus didn't update the same to amozon, Rightnow i am hanging between amozon and one plus.Question 1- No bargaining was done at the time of purchase so why am i suppose to visit oneplus service station and stand in the queue with new phone and over that why someone spend on fuel for the same.Question 2- Suppose i had opted for my mobile excange at the time of purchase, the person would be without phone untill the problem addressed.Amazon people are worried about their written policy and procedure while the customer facing all the trouble.Zoom the picture to see defective display.","Read before buying, my worst purchase",1.0 out of 5 stars

"Writing this review after more than 10 days of usage. Phone was delivered on 28th February..so far the experience has not been up to expectations. Below are some pros and cons of this phone.Pros- Excellent display. Great for multimedia consumption- Excellent battery life. Gives almost 9 hours SOT even on performance mode.- Primary camera takes good photos.- All sensors work great- Sound quality is good- Haptics are of flagship level- Looks classy and great in hand feel- Superfast charging.Cons- Lots of bugs with the OxyColor OS- Laggy when multiple apps are opened- I can't make or receive calls. Every time I have to restart my phone for calls to work.- Wide and front cameras are of average quality. Macro is basically useless.- YouTube videos stutter when other apps like WhatsApp and Chrome are open.- The 16/256 GB version may be better but why should I spend 5k extra when 8/128 GB version phones at this price range perform much better and I don't play games so the extra Ram and storage are completely useless for me. Mid range Samsung phones are much better than this phone. So opt for them instead.All in all its an average phone. Don't go by YouTube reviews, there are many better phones than this under the same price range. Build quality and looks are classy but it disappoints in the software department. Still many many updates are needed to fix the bugs hope OnePlus/Oppo can act on it fast! Thinking of selling this phone soon. The old OnePlus feeling is completely gone.",Classy looks but low on performance!!!,3.0 out of 5 stars

Notification unable to drag down n see info in the notification bar itself.5.they mentioned mobile back was glass ,but I feel like it's plastic alteast if they provided glass back as OnePlus 11 then it would be good deal.6.once you added one bitmoji  unable to change to new bitmoji facing issue.7.onehand mode was having bug when we are using onehand mode (📳 considering in app drawer) not able to see last 2 rows of apps .8.

"Screen is more of warm side.. But no issues.Even with 60 Hz of refresh rate, no lag for the regular use. Mobile is smooth.I feel like battery is draining faster. Drained from 100 to 16% with 7 h 30 mins screen time with dark mode, 60hz refresh rate. If we go out and use camera more, battery will drain faster than this. Basically battery needs optimisation.By any chance,if we use 120Hz refresh rate and put the mobile in high performance mode, battery will drain faster like anything.I bought 128 GB storage version. 18 GB is occupied by the system. 12 GB is for Apps. Finally I left with 57 GB in the beginning itself. Better go with highest storage of you use camera more.Update :Pros: when you hood it with single hand, there are chances that your palm will touch the edge of the screen. By that time, if you touch the screen with your finger. It won't work. Personally I don't like curved edge.Next is that finger print sensor has been placed at the same where we have call end button.

"Value for money phone. Check the points, my be one of these points help you in selecting your next phone:1. Excellent build quality and design,no complaints, anyone can easily say it's flagship if u r using it outside2. Sound/Call quality good, u won't face issues3. Battery 6-7 hrs SOTwith 120hz on , easily lasting 1and half day as per my usage4. Display - excellent, top end flagship level5. It might not have official IP ratings but check Gupta test in YouTube it can withstand water, so practically sudnt be an issue6. Camera- It's good, crisp and clear, only 1 issue I'm noticing is it tries to darken the areas wherever shadows r there, S21 FE camera looks better in this aspect, that keeps good lighting in photos even in dark areas. If u leave those dark areas, OP photos look more crisp and clear and look premium. Its definitely better than 20-25k phone cameras. If u won't compare with S21FE ull like it. In S21FE images u get better lighting but it looks dull, crispiness wise OP looks better. In selfies it tries to whitens the image but an avg looking person will like it😁If camera is your priority I won't recommend you this, for all other factors it'll truly feel like a flagship (I'm not a gamer, not tested games), for camera it's above average but not on leagues with Samsung Apple flagships, but again they'll cost 20-30k more so keep this also in mind",Flagship Smartphone with average camera,4.0 out of 5 stars

I'm  was looking to buy a mobile which fulfill  all my needs and also look rich and feels good while keeping it in hand.One plus servs all my requiremt  and after using it for a month I'm  giving this review.It's  a flagship mobile and it serves me completely.Screen is fab.Battery  backup  is normal. Expected  more  as like Samsung  mobiles. But this also good.Voice is too good. Music is crisp and clear.Catching  5G network very good till now as per area network  availability.Camera is just awesome.  Clicks and pictures  quality  is fab in both sunny day and in low light.I didn't  played  heavy duty game on it. So unable to give review it  gaming  point of view. Still its a flagship processor so gaming experience  also be good i hope.!Go for it..!!Cons.:-1.Little heavy. Its okay for these days coz all new upcoming mobiles are above 180g.2.become hot while on call like other normal mobiles. Didn't  Expected  from flagship mobile or it may be my call duration is  long. Above 10mins.3.need to keep screen refresh  speed low to save battery.,Worth the money. GO FOR IT.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Overall this is a good device under 40K. I will compare the this device with samsung S21 fe which I have used and you can get for as low as 32K to 35K in some sales. My review of different features is as follows,1. Display - 4/5 - quite good but not as good as display of flagship samsung devices even S21 fe2. Battery - 5/5 - if you set-up your phone appropriately, i.e. disable 120Hz, no Always on Display, etc you can get even 8-9 hours of SoT. S21 fe has terrible battery doesn't even give more than 5 hours SoT3. Camera - 4/5 - primary camera is quite good, but ultra wide and macro are ok. S21 fe has all 3 cameras much better.4. Performance - 4/5 - for normal use (not hardcare gaming), it is quite good. S21 fe has slightly poor performance.5. Software - 3/5 - overall software experience is acceptable but not as good as samsung phones.6. Heating - 4/5 - although this phone heats much less than S21 fe, but if you use it in direct sunlight on a hot summer afternoon, the display can get hot which likely is case with most phones, I guessIf you want better camera and you can compromise on battery/heat and you are not a gamer, you can go with S21 fe. Else this phone is best option under 40K.",Good phone under 40K,4.0 out of 5 stars

"So I have been using this phone for a month now. And I think this is phone is great. In case of camera, battery performance, charging speed etc. Everything is great. I love how the battery performe. If you charge it 100% and you don't do any havy stuff like gaming or editing. If you only call or just put your phone down or just text a little. It will stay 100% for more than 1 hour. Sound quality is really impressive and the camera is as good as that. I am super satisfied. Now about gaming. If you are a havy gamer don't worry you won't face any lags but yes there are frame drops in bgmi 90fps. But if you play 60fps it's constant 59 to 60fps. No drops at all. In other cases it's still a beast. If you are planning to buy it. I would suggest just go for it. The price is worth it and also do not forget you get a primium in hand look and a primium haptic feedback.",For gamers.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm writing this review almost after one month of using the phone.Pros:1. Elegant looking, robust-built and feel premium in hands2. Curved screen is awesome and display is also excellent. Vibrant colors, 120Hz refresh rate and a large 6.7"" screen will make you glued to the phone. I have not experienced any eye strain even after prolong use.3. Both the front and rear cameras have done their job beautifully. Photos are crisp, prominent and not overly saturated. Rear camera panel also looks premium.4. This phone comes with a jumbo 5000mAh battery and 100w fast charger. My mobile gets charged fully within 20mins!Even though the phone comes with an 100w charger, I will recommend users to use a 40-60w charger to extend the longevity of your phone battery. I have not experience any heating issue in the phone till now.5. Side notch button for easily putting the phone on silent/vibration/normal mode similar to iPhone. I feel this feature quite handy as I have to frequently attend business meetings and thus require to change my phone ringing mode multiple times.6. On-screen fingerprint scanner is fast and does its job without any hiccups.7. It has IR sensor which enables this phone to be used as remote controller for your TV, AC, Set top box etc. I'm using my phone as a remote for my tata sky set top box and blue star AC. It works so perfectly that I'm now little bothered about their actual remote.Cons:You have to seriously scratch your head to find any major problem with this phone. However, face log-in is not as smooth and fast like high end phones especially during low light/night times. But, in day time or when there is ample light available, face log-im does its job perfectly.Final verdict:After many years, OnePlus has come up with a performance giant that too at a very affordable price. Amazon is also offering old phone exchange offer while purchasing this phone. One Plus 11r is premium featured and looks elegant. At this price range, it is a killer buying. Go for it without any hesitation!",Most underrated premium and elegant phone at this price range,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Camera : camera is decent.. it's average, sometimes it takes awesome pictures and sometimes don't. Not good in low light... And also boost the colors and can't catch (or idk if it's hiding) details... Like my one of friend had worn lakhnvi kurta, and after taking the pic that maroon color kurta it was looking like red color kurta and not lakhvnvi but plain kurta...😅 I've uploaded images for that... First image of kurta was taken by iphone and look at there and the second one was taken by this narzo 60x...you can see the difference... So if your priority is not camera or you are satisfied with above images you must go for it...Sound quality: it's normal... And mostly i use wireless neckband or tws so it fine for me.....Battery : battery backup is good, since it has big display it will use more battery, but if you use with low brightness then it gives amazing backup...Also you should keep turning off background processes by going into setting and search process manager and end the process which you won't like to run in background and also you can freez app so they won't be used in background... As an example i use insta for watching reels only so I have freezed the app and so it won't run in background but as i open it will work normal..This things can save much much ram and also battery...Ease of use: ui is good, all features are available like ,internet speed,daily data usage,One handed mode,Bottom slide finger to change recent app,Screen off gestures -> double tap turn on off, draw on lock sceeen and open some app..Youtube background playEtc....Performance : it is good for regular usage, I didn't feel any leg while using the mohile, and since I don't play games, I can't say about mobile while playing games...it doesn't get heat while watching youtube and Instagram...App opening and closing is fast...Ram management: Ram management is good but  i can't understand that virtual ram(z-ram what they called).. I didn't find any usecase of it until now...Display: display attracted me a lot, i mean colors are too good....and I also have used it in sunlight, everything was visible properlyI also checked antutu score by myself in this deviceThe device has setting about  refresh rate and  perfomance modeSo,with 60hz refresh rate and balance mode i got antutu score of 4,10,000With 120hz and high perfomance mode I got 4,20,000Note: antutu score may very depending upon any background porcess runnig or not, bluetooth wifi is on or off....and also near by temperature affect itSo try  using close all the apps and also if try it with in appropriate temperature and also don't put your mobile in charging...I don't know above things will affect antutu score or not but still to be on safe side this things are necessary..",It cost me 11500(in Amazon great indian festival deal),4.0 out of 5 stars
"Phone looks good, but not feel premium while holding, build of cheap plastic.  camera bump should be in the middle.Camera below average even my redmi 7s (2018 model) has the better camera, front camera is worst.Display poor can see a little screen bleeding on black background, colors are not sharp and proper.Phone is little oversize might be difficult to operate.Bought this for my father and he is happy with this.","Entry level phone, for beginners only",4.0 out of 5 stars

"I have been using this phone for almost two months now and I do not have any complaint regarding it. The best part of the phone is it's battery backup. Even if you charge it in the morning and keep on using it the whole day still the whole battery won't drain out. Moreover, everyone thinks that due to one speaker its sound quality might be low. Even I was sceptical before buying but it's nothing as such. The sound quality of the phone is amazing, with and without headphones. The back camera is pretty good for day and nature photography. Front camera is so so, not that good. Overall you can go for this product in the given prize range. 👍",Review,4.0 out of 5 stars

"Narzo 60x.. Such a wonderful phone at this price range.. Same as of 11x by realme.. Only camera is 50mp but more excellent than 11x as its a new camera rather than the old 64 mp one in 11x,some samples adding..I got it for 11250 the 6/128 version and also exchange value of 2500 for my 3.5 old infinix hot 8..so was a very good deal for the shoping festival days... Now the price is 14999..Camera is excellent but lacking image stability durinh video recording.. Also 4k not available.g Battery backup 5000mah is deceny, havent tried any games yt, but the antutu score is nearby 4.2 lakhs.. So definitely will give a medium experience👌.. Also about the display very good with 700nits and rolls out with latest Android 13 with realme UI 4 with 2years update and 3years security updates.. So you will get android 14 nd 15..thats a good thing😍..If your getting the phone below 12500 thats a very good deal whereas the same one with number series thats 11x is just 1000rs extra for the same variants with same specs and features..Go for it.. Its good",Narzo 60x ❤️👌,4.0 out of 5 stars

"If you're looking for a smartphone for day-to-day tasks like browsing the web, scrolling through social media, and watching movies, then this phone is for you.Pros:1.Display:I'm really surprised by its display. It offers a 120 Hz refresh rate and supports 1080p resolution. When watching a movie, it gives you an immersive experience.2.Sound:The mono speaker offers very good sound quality. The 'real sound technology' in this phone is very useful for watching movies and listening to music.3.Battery:The 5000mAh battery and 33W charger are sufficient. For normal users, the battery gives about 10 hours of screen-on time (SOT).4.Network:5G and 4G work really well. I haven't faced any problems related to network speed or range issues.Cons:1.Processor:This phone uses a very outdated processor. When you try games like BGMI or Free Fire, the phone will start to heat up. Also, when you play for 1 hour or more, there are issues with frame drops, and the game gets laggy.2.Heating Issue:Even with normal use, the phone occasionally gets hot. Sometimes, you can literally fry an egg using the backside of this phone.3.Front Camera:Horrible front camera performance. It doesn't offer the quality of even a below 10K budget phone. The rear camera is decent.",Decent buy if you are a normal user,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Decent Performance: Equipped with capable processors, these devices ensure smooth operation for daily activities and can handle moderate gaming tasks effectively.  Long Battery Life: Often equipped with sizable batteries, these phones boast impressive longevity, ensuring prolonged usage without frequent recharging.  Quality Displays: The displays generally deliver satisfactory performance for their price range, with certain models boasting high refresh rates, enhancing the gaming experience and overall interface smoothness.  Camera Performance: While the camera quality may not match that of premium devices, it remains adequate for most users, although it may struggle in low-light conditions.  Youthful Design: Sporting vibrant and sometimes flashy designs, Realme Narzo phones appeal to the younger demographic, offering a solid build quality typically utilizing cost-effective plastic materials.  Realme UI Software: Running on Realme UI, which is based on Android, these devices provide a user-friendly experience, albeit potentially burdened with some pre-installed apps.",Unveiling the Realme Narzo Series: Affordable Performance Tailored for the Youthful Gamer,4.0 out of 5 stars

"I have been using Realme Narzo 60x 5g for quite sometime so here is my review of this device.Pros:1. Smooth experience - This device has 120hz display, therefore it's provides smooth scrolling experience if set at 120hz.2. Battery life - This device has good battery life once charged upto 80 percent it can last full day on normal use.3. Fast charging - This device comes with 33 watt fast charger which can charge the 5000 mah battery of this device upto 80 percent in 1 and half hour.Cons : 1. Sound quality - The Microphone sound volume and quality is low, this phone is not for those who use phone primarily for calling as it's sound volume is low so what other person is talking may not be audible sometimes.2. Music sound quality is low - This is not for those who love listening music at high volume since the sound volume is low. The loudspeaker is a single speaker not dual. speaker's sound volume is not that high3. Dull display - This device's has a big display but the display is slight yellow in colour. At first I thought night mode or eye protection is on so I checked it and it was not on. So the display is itself slight yellow in colour which can affect multimedia experience. You may not like watching YouTube videos from this device as the video appears yellowish.Update:- After software updates the yellowness has reduced.3. Camera -* Front camera : The device has decent front camera which clicks good selfies but it over whiten's the skin tone so it don't look natural but the selfiesquality is decent to be uploaded in social media.* Rear camera - The rear camera is of decent quality but it don't work very well in low light conditions. After clicking photo the device takes 2 to 3 seconds to process the image.* Video camera - The videos shot from this device's camera is decent. This phone supports slow motion but the slow motion videos are blurry and faded.",Honest review,4.0 out of 5 stars

So I bought this as a budget phone with 5g . The camera is a negative point . It's ai always making the pictures look like polished rather natural . Front camera feels like 2mp .worse in low light . Video of the front camera is so so pixeleted even in a watsapp call. The pictures looks heavily filtered. And I would like it to be off or something. I can't even return it unless there is damage or missing parts or something. Battery is okay . Screen is very llow quality look as well.,Real me nazro is just ok product,2.0 out of 5 stars

"I've been using this Phone for a month,My Honest Review🔋Battery - No worry for a whole day of average usage if you charged once fully, even at Heavy usage it lasts enough🔌Charging - No other brands provides 33w charger in this Budget of 5G phones, So charging speed is so Good📱Display - Right now For this Budget in 5G segment we can't expect a LED Display but in a daily usage you won't feel any Difference unless you purposely look for the difference, so this LCD display is Fine too No problem with that🔆Brightness - For Indoor it is Fine, Manageable at Outdoor, But Difficult to use under Direct Sunlight📸Camera - Same opinion for Both Front and Rear Camera, In good Lighting Condition it performs so Good and Better than some 20-25k segment phones but in Low Light conditions the Picture is so poor full of nothing but a broken pixels. But as said above this Camera is Best for this Budget🎮Gaming - Yes you can Play even Heavy Games without any Lag or Framedrops, But I haven't tested a longtime Gaming so I can't say anything on it.🌡️Temperature - After a Heavy use or Heavy Gaming we can surely feel a slight warm on the phone but not an Heating issues but still it get warm📶Connectivity - 5G connection is Good and Speed but it depends on the Network provider and Location, but the important thing is if you don't want a 5G phone, you have other options with similar features at lower price but if you want 5G device it is worth to spend🧩Design - You and others around won't feel it as a phone under 15k, because the camera module and the punch hole Display makes it look so premium🦾Build - I don't want to test it😅, but no protection for screen was specified like Gorilla or Panda glass, It'd be better if they provided that🎙️Mic and Sound quality🎧 - It has 2 mics that is Good but don't expect much difference, Sound quality also Decent only not so good🔴Multitasking🔴This is were the Huge problem of this phone arise don't expect a good multitasking experience in this phone, I don't know why but every time when I use more than one apps at a time it consistently getting closed at the background, for e.g. while writing this review itself I got a message from my message in WhatsApp, I opened it and replied then after when coming to Amazon, the app launched freshly so I had to type everything again from the beginning, I didn't closed it from the recent apps but still it opens like that then why it has Recent apps option. This one is a Big Headache. I'm trying to solve this by using many settings but still haven't found a way to fix itSo Simply It is the Best option in every aspects in this Price range but there is a problem in multitasking",Worth for Money.

"3 month Used review- charging with 1 hr and 20 mints full, but at 120hzs battery will drain fast.- No heat while gaming using hotspot ,gps, but heating during normal day to day usage, social media,charging( mild) , zoom meet ( heavy).- camera performance is not so good, but for the price can't expect more, quality will enhancee if you edit photos in gallery. Other brands provides better cam at this range.- internet speed no issue, calls no issue, mic and noice cancelling could have been better.- speaker is just okay, not that loud ,not that clear, but for normal usage its completely okay.- sometimes you may find slight lag in home interface probably some software issue, but app opeing and witching is pretty good- you can use it like a clean android without bloatwares and adds, if you uninstall all unnecessary apps , desable appwise adds and corrrect setting.- Good phone for normal usage, not for camera, or selfy people,- day to day activities will work seemlessly.- Holding in your hand and keeping in your pocket may feel a bit trouble, due its inhand feel. This issue may not be there for all, as my analysis is based on my previous phone which was smaller and half of the battery capacity.- i don't know how to compare display quality, yet this seems normal. Good actually.- i have nothing to say about chip set, seems fine in normal usage, no gaming, no heavy apps tested, but good with pdf, social medias , studies, a 10 /12 apps may be installed extra, thats it.- You may have to test zoom app separately if you are looking to use it , i don't really understand why zoom causes this much heat.- uttrer disappointment with hostpot, it is not working properly when using in 2.4ghz, 5 works  fine, this is a serious trouble and i think its there in all phones  . The connected device will keep disconnecting or it will not recognise the hotspot in its wifi scanning, they need to fix this.Google mapas will always show wrong direction, no matter how hard you try in settings or calibration, it will not work. Even if it show correct direction, it will change in a few minutes, you will easily get confused by using google maps, first time having such an issue",Not as good as advertised,1.0 out of 5 stars

I said no no he said that you'll replacement my mobile.. no mam he is from amazon not from realme.. and I was fooled by both of them..

According to Amazon Care's advice, I did not deposit my phone at the Realme service center, and I did not receive a ""DO"" letter.

Love that realme really cares about their customers so they gave a proper packaged box with: charger, screen guard, phone cover.Screen guard isn't that good quality so it's recommended that you buy a robust one.5. Smooth and sound is goodOverall good budget simple phone for general simple use",Value for money,3.0 out of 5 stars

"This is a very good phone with all features needed for the new generation.Some key features are:-Good battery backup-  1 day backup after full charge on using it for about 8 hrs per day33W supervooc charger is the best that can charge the phone from less than 10 % to 100% in 1hr.amazing display with super smooth 120Hz rate.Cons- I am using it for a month and I have not found any thing bad about this phone except that the realme UI features are less as compared to other brand like Redmi and Samsung.Furthermore it does not support NFC payments.Summary - The phone is best for a College guy for multitasking and daily use for creating assignments, reading notes and creating ppts, etc.",Amazing picture quality and Ultra Fast Charging,4.0 out of 5 stars
"After  nearly 2 months heavy usage here's my review -Pros-sleek and lightweight with a 6.72-inch LCD display and a 120 Hz refresh rate.It has a good performance with the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ processor and a 5,000 mAh battery with 33W fast charging. It also has a 50 MP primary camera that delivers decent and colourful shots in daylight.You can play bgmi in hd and CODM on mid frame.Cons- lacks an ultra-wide camera and has a average low-light performance.You get LCD display instead of an AMOLED display, which has lower contrast and brightness and does not support some features. Its good option for those who want a 5G smartphone with a smooth display and a long-lasting battery with decent gaming and usage but not for those who want a better camera and display quality.",Near allrounder experience,4.0 out of 5 stars
My first reason to get this phone was to use 5g....but then my last device was from 2021 and a lot of things has changed so I was curious to use a smartphone released recently....I totally love everything about this phone....the phone is really fast and all the apps I use stays in the ram(mine is 6 GB Ram)I plays games like zepeto and Pokemon go and this phone handles the games efficiently... zepeto is one of the games which utilizes a lot of graphics but in this it's smooth af😭❤️...the display is beautiful and really smooth as they say...I use the display in auto refresh rate mode...the system apps support 120hz whereas some other apps like insta and all use 90hz... coming to the battery life...maybe because I'm coming from 60hz the battery seems to drain faster since it's 120hz and 5g I think.... anyways a 7hr sot will be enough to carry out the whole day~And about the main reason I brought 5g...in my area 5g is not implemented properly yet in my room and in specific areas I get 5g😅 which I'm happy...since itbwas a wonder for me to see downloading apps in one tap....the phone installs the apps pretty fast....I deleted and desabled all the bloatwares and now the ui is also nice....one disappointment about the ui is that It lacks app opening and closing animation.... it's a 15k phone and still lacks that!!!even realme 11x have it....and this phone is same as 11x except the camera....the ui customisation is endless even without buying any themes from theme store... I'm in love with this phone anyways.... thank you Realme❤️❤️,Absolutely wonderful ✨,5.0 out of 5 stars
"As of my last update in April 2023, the Realme Narzo series is known for being a budget-friendly smartphone line, catering mainly to a younger demographic with a focus on gaming and performance at an affordable price point. However, for a detailed review, it's important to know the specific model you're referring to, as the series includes multiple models with varying features and specifications.In general, Realme Narzo phones tend to offer:1. **Good Performance**: They usually come with decent processors that provide smooth performance in day-to-day tasks and can handle moderate gaming.2. **Battery Life**: These phones often feature large batteries, providing long-lasting battery life.3. **Display**: The displays are typically good for the price range, with some models offering high refresh rates which is a bonus for gaming and general smoothness in the interface.4. **Camera**: The camera quality is usually acceptable for the price, though it might not compete with higher-end devices, especially in low-light conditions.5. **Build and Design**: They have a youthful and sometimes flashy design, with a build quality that's solid but typically uses plastic materials to keep costs down.6. **Software**: They run on Realme UI, which is based on Android. The user experience is generally user-friendly, though it might include some bloatware.",Good,5.0 out of 5 stars
"DisplayIps Lcd but its good quality panel, I was used to amoled previously yes you will notice some difference but it doesn't bother you at all, Cause the changing the colour scheme to warm is giving good amoled feel, only when the room is dark and using a black screen you will notice the difference unless everything is perfectBatteryIt comes throughout the dayDesignLight weight in hand feel, My purple color is so goodProcessorBe sure to optimize everything in settings as some realme options make it slower like inteligent svcheme, performance mode, if rgese settings ot consuming more processes you will face some stuttering or else it can be fine5GWowwww around 700mbps, in 5g which is never expected for this range equal to flagship speedsBloatwareFull bloatware, i was very worried unless i figured the way to disable every useless and unwanted apps hot games and hotapps, I like  clean os, i dont say its clean but we can make all the unwanted and remove so it becomes such a clean phone now i was surprised with itSpeakerAverage no so clear but ok can be managebleCameraAverage but iuse google mod came for better use of hardware provided and softare magic gives better pictures, native camera is a bummer 😞Price i got 6+128 at 11,999 which is better , My suggestion is to not to go for 4gb variant as it does not  give much performance,My way of thinking - I am the type of guy who doesn't like spending much on a smartphone, So just go for it and enjoy the way of using this low cost phone rough and tough no need to worry as it is already a cheap one 😉, for info my previous phone is redmi note 10s 64gb, main reason to change is storage issue",Just Awesome,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros:Super-fast 5G: The Narzo 60X shines with its MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ chipset, offering smooth performance and future-proofing for 5G.Snappy 120Hz display: Enjoy buttery-smooth visuals with the 120Hz refresh rate LCD panel, ideal for gaming and scrolling.Decent cameras: The 50MP main sensor captures good photos in daylight, while the 2MP depth sensor helps with portraits.Large battery: The 5,000mAh battery easily handles a day's worth of usage, eliminating battery anxiety.Affordable price: Priced under $200, the Narzo 60X offers a compelling value proposition for budget-conscious buyers seeking 5G speeds.Cons:LCD panel: Although 120Hz, the LCD display lacks the vibrancy and contrast of OLED panels found in some competitors.Average cameras: The low-light performance is mediocre, and the 2MP depth sensor feels gimmicky.Plastic build: The phone feels less premium compared to metal or glass-bodied options.Verdict:The Realme Narzo 60X 5G is a great choice for budget-minded users seeking a future-proofed smartphone with 5G capabilities and a smooth display. While the cameras and build quality could be better, the overall package is hard to beat at its price point.",Realme Narzo 60X 5G Review: Budget 5G Speed Demon,5.0 out of 5 stars
"ProsDisplay - beautiful large, sharp, vibrant and very bright with 120Hz refresh rateBuild quality - well built product, comes with pre-installed plastic screen guard and a silicone case. I didn't like the colour of the phone which is nebula purpleProcessor - great for daily usage like Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, mails etc. Casual Gaming can be done. No lags, and decent app opening speed.Software - it comes with Android 13 out of the box, 2 yrs software & 3 yrs security updates are promised by realme. It has good amount of features such side bar, privacy folder, app lock, app hide, gestures controls etc.Network receiption - good, can be considered above average, I could not test 5g though.Battery & charging - battery backup is not tested extensively but seems average, charging speed is good though with that 33 watt charger which is in the box.Dedicated micro SD card slot - yes and supports memory cards upto 1tbConsBloatware - there is a lot of bloatware most of which can be deleted or disabled but it's annoying. Ads & various shitty recommendations are seen but most of it can be avoided with the right settings, I would say this is a con but not a deal breaker.Average battery backupAverage cameras both front & rearLoudspeaker - it could have been slightly louder and sound quality could have been better",Excellent 5g phone in a budget,5.0 out of 5 stars
"1. Processor is 6100+ looks good at price point2. Phone have only 1 speaker but it's much louder than 2 speakers.3. Phone looks quite bigger when holding. Gives you satisfaction.4. Phone back was made with polycarbonate but with 3d designing made his polycarbonate looks like premium glass.5. It works with both 4g and 5g sims.6. 5g Wifi connectivity is also available.7. 50 mp ai camera is looks decent , if they provide 64 mp give more satisfaction. Please note that : ( this phone doesn't have ultra wide camera mode)8. Also have side mounted fingerprint scanner.9. According to gaming perspective, mediatek 6100+ contains 400000+ antutu score. Which means you can play pubg as well as free fire without lag. ( But if you are playing on highest settings and also screen recording them , then it might be possible to face some lag.)10. Device contains 33v supervooc ultra fast charging. Nearly tAke 1-1:20 hours to get fully charged. )11. Device also contains 120 hertz refresh rate. Works soo smooth.12. They also contains some pre installed applications and hot apps advertising on homepage. But we can turn off the hot apps suggestions from realme app store or app market settings.PLEASE LIKE THE REVIEW. IF YOU FEEL ITS HELPFUL OR MONEY SAVING.",Realme 60x 5g review,5.0 out of 5 stars

"My second Realme Narzo after the first lasted me 3 years and still going good in the hands of my daughter. No other Android including any major brands ever went more than 2 years with me. With its exceptional network coverage, dust and water proof ability, great battery and even greater value for money with screen guard and cover for free, I think I have got more than what I have paid for in buying this phone. Though Bloatware is a bit of an issue but otherwise everything is great. Thanks a lot Realme.",Fabulous phone,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I recently got a new mobile phone and I must say, I am impressed with the camera quality and the processor's smooth performance. The result screen is also exceptional. As a beginner photographer, I was surprised by the quality of the pictures I could capture. The experience was seamless with no delay in anything. I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a device with a remarkable camera and a sophisticated processor that's perfect for both gaming and photography. The camera's quality is truly remarkable, and the pictures come out splendidly. This phone is also perfect for gaming, (games like Call of Duty, Free Fire, and BGMI on high-end graphics)with a processor that can handle even the most demanding games. In conclusion, I am extremely satisfied with this phone and would recommend it without hesitation to anyone searching for a device that excels in both gaming and photography.Additionally, the battery life is exceptional. I was able to use the phone for an entire day while only consuming 50 per cent of its battery. Moreover, even when using 5G on other devices, the battery consumption is minimal. While the phone may heat up slightly, this poses no issue. In conclusion, I highly recommend this phone to anyone seeking a dependable and efficient device. Additionally, it is incredibly user-friendly and easy to navigate. I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase and confident that you will be too. Without hesitation, I urge you to invest in this phone as you will not regret it.",THIS PHONE IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL,5.0 out of 5 stars
